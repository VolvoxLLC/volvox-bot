# Prompt Registry

Copy/paste prompt templates for AI agents working with Veritas Kanban.

## Usage

1. Copy the relevant prompt from this registry
2. Customize placeholders (`<task-id>`, `<project>`, etc.) for your context
3. Reference in task descriptions: `See prompt: prompt-registry/<name>.md`

# Edit to match your conventions
vim my-project/prompts/sprint-planning.md
```
