# 2026-02-12 — Pip Build Daily Notes

## Rate Limit Cascade Incident (~11:34 AM – 12:14+ PM EST)

- **All four providers** hit rate limits simultaneously: Anthropic (Opus 4.6, Haiku 4.5), OpenAI Codex, Gemini Pro, Gemini Flash
- Pip (main agent, Discord) was completely locked out — 26+ failures logged
- Build agent (me, webchat) continued working fine on Anthropic — API-level rate limit had cleared but OpenClaw's internal cooldown timers were stale
- Root cause: Anthropic HTTP 429 cascading to all fallback providers
- Contributing factors: heavy concurrent usage across both agents sharing same API keys, plus heartbeats/cron/Gmail hooks/sub-agents competing
- **PR patrol cron** (every 10 min on Opus) was the biggest contributor — had 12 consecutive errors
- Gmail webhook hook `gmail-volvox:19c52ce2633d95bd` also failing during cooldown

## Fixes Applied

1. **Gateway restart** at ~12:15 PM — cleared stale cooldown state, Pip came back online
2. **PR patrol cron DISABLED** (`8b380d56-7314-4ba9-b4c4-ea11d3e5ca6f`) — was hammering providers every 10 min
3. **Model switched to GLM 4.7** (`zai/glm-4.7`) — both main agents and sub-agents now use GLM 4.7 primary, with Opus/Codex as fallbacks
4. **Sub-agent config updated** — primary: `zai/glm-4.7`, fallbacks: `anthropic/claude-opus-4-6`, `openai-codex/gpt-5.3-codex`

## New Rules from Bill

- **Only review Bill's PRs (or my own)** — do NOT check, fix, or address PRs from anyone else (other contributors like AnExiledDev, bots) unless Bill explicitly says to. Updated in MEMORY.md and HEARTBEAT.md.

## Morning Board Check (cron)

- Veritas Kanban updated 3.1.0 → 3.2.1, server restarted
- 38 tasks on board (7 done, 31 todo)
- 2 open PRs from AnExiledDev (#19, #20) — hands off per new rule

## PR #20 Sub-Agent Spawned

- PR #20 (`feat/moderation-commands-v2`) had 18 unresolved threads — spawned sub-agent on GLM 4.7
- **NOTE:** This was spawned BEFORE Bill's "don't review other people's PRs" rule. PR #20 is by AnExiledDev. Future runs should skip it.
