# Weekly Changelog Update

## Purpose

After each ISO week ends, compile a recap of all user-facing changes shipped
during the most recently completed ISO week and add it to **both** changelog surfaces:

1. `docs/changelog.mdx` — Mintlify changelog (MDX `<Update>` components).
2. `docs/wiki-pages/Changelog.md` — GitHub wiki changelog (plain Markdown).

## Instructions for the Agent

### 1. Determine the completed ISO week

Calculate the ISO week number and date range for the most recently completed ISO week.
For the scheduled Monday run, this is the Monday–Sunday week that ended the previous day.
For manual `workflow_dispatch` runs, do not summarize the in-progress week; use the latest
fully completed ISO week unless the user explicitly asks for another range.
Examples: `2026-W18` covers April 27–May 3, 2026; `2026-W19` covers May 4–10, 2026.

### 2. Fetch merged PRs for the completed week

Query the repository for all PRs merged during Monday–Sunday of the completed ISO week.
Examine each PR's title, description, labels, and changed files.

### 3. Filter to user-facing changes

**Include** PRs that change features, UX, API behavior, configuration, commands, or
user-visible documentation.

**Exclude** PRs that are purely internal with no user-visible impact:
- `chore:` dependency bumps or tooling changes with no behavioral effect
- `ci:` pipeline and workflow changes only
- `test:` test-only additions or fixes
- `refactor:` internal restructures with identical behavior
- Merge commits and automated bot PRs that do not add user-facing value

### 4. Write the weekly recap in `docs/changelog.mdx`

Insert a new `<Update>` block at the **very top** of the file, immediately after the
YAML frontmatter (the `---` block). Place it before any existing `<Update>` entries.

**Block format:**

```mdx
<Update label="YYYY-W##" description="Week of <Mon D> – <Fri D>, YYYY" tags={["Weekly recap"]}>
## This week in Volvox.Bot

<One sentence describing the week's overall theme.>

**Feature or fix name** — One-sentence description with a [docs link](/features/relevant) when applicable.

**Another change** — One sentence.

For day-by-day details, see the entries below.
</Update>
```

Rules:
- `label` must be the ISO week string (e.g., `2026-W18`). Zero-pad single-digit weeks.
- `description` uses the Monday–Friday date range of the week (not Monday–Sunday).
- `tags` is always `{["Weekly recap"]}`.
- List each notable change as a `**bold heading** — one sentence` bullet.
- Link to relevant Mintlify docs pages using relative paths (e.g., `/features/moderation`,
  `/dashboard`, `/features/tldr`).
- End with `For day-by-day details, see the entries below.`
- The label must be unique across all existing entries in the file. Check for collisions
  before inserting.

### 5. Write individual daily entries in `docs/changelog.mdx`

For each day in the completed week that had at least one merged user-facing PR and does
**not** already have a `<Update label="YYYY-MM-DD" ...>` entry, add a new daily entry.
Insert daily entries in reverse-chronological order, below the weekly recap block and
above the previous week's entries.

**Daily entry format:**

```mdx
<Update label="YYYY-MM-DD" description="<Month> YYYY" tags={["Features", "Improvements", "Fixes"]}>
## New features

**Feature name** — One-sentence description. Link to [docs page](/features/relevant).

## Improvements

**Improvement name** — One sentence.

## Fixes

**Fix name** — One sentence.
</Update>
```

Rules:
- Only include section headings (`## New features`, `## Improvements`, `## Fixes`) for
  types that actually appear in that day's changes. Omit empty sections.
- Tags should reflect which types are present: include `"Features"` only if there are
  new features, `"Improvements"` only if there are improvements, `"Fixes"` only if there
  are fixes.
- Skip days with no user-facing merged PRs.
- Skip days that already have an entry in the file.

### 6. Update the wiki changelog in `docs/wiki-pages/Changelog.md`

Insert a new `##` section at the top, immediately after the introductory paragraph and
before the previous week's section.

**Section format:**

```markdown
## Week YYYY-W## (Mon D – Fri D, YYYY)

<One sentence describing the week's overall theme.>

- **Feature or fix name** — One-sentence description.
- **Another change** — One sentence.
```

Rules:
- Use plain Markdown only — no MDX components.
- Section heading: `## Week YYYY-W## (Mon D – Fri D, YYYY)`.
- Each item is a `- **bold name** — one sentence` bullet.
- No links to internal docs pages (wiki readers may not have access to the Mintlify site).
- Keep the section concise — cover the same highlights as the weekly recap.

### 7. Create a pull request

If any changes were made to either file, create a PR:

- **Branch**: `copilot/weekly-changelog-YYYY-W##`
  <!-- NOTE: Replace YYYY-W## with the actual ISO week computed at runtime
       (e.g., copilot/weekly-changelog-2025-W03 for the third week of 2025).
       A static string causes branch collisions on repeated weekly runs. -->
- **Title**: `docs(changelog): week YYYY-W## recap`
- **Description**: List the PRs reviewed and summarize the changes captured in both files.
- **Label**: `documentation`
- **Auto-merge**: Enable if all checks pass.

### 8. Quality checks before opening the PR

- All `<Update>` `label` values in `docs/changelog.mdx` are unique.
- Weekly recap label is `YYYY-W##` (e.g., `2026-W18`). Single-digit weeks are zero-padded.
- Daily entry labels are `YYYY-MM-DD`.
- The weekly recap block appears before all daily entries for that week.
- Wiki `Changelog.md` sections use `## Week YYYY-W##` headers.
- All relative links in MDX entries point to pages that exist in `docs/docs.json`.

### 9. If no user-facing changes were merged during the completed week

Skip creating a PR. Log a note that no user-facing changes were found for the completed week.
