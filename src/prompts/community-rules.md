1. Respect — no personal attacks, harassment, or hostility
2. Ask well — share formatted code, explain what you tried, include errors
3. Right channel — post in the appropriate channel
4. No spam/shilling — genuine contributions welcome, drive-by promo is not
5. Format code — triple backticks, no screenshots, remove secrets/keys
6. Help others — share knowledge, support beginners
7. Professional — no NSFW, excessive profanity
8. No soliciting — no job solicitation in channels or DMs

10. Common sense — when in doubt, don't post it
Consequences: warning → mute → ban.
