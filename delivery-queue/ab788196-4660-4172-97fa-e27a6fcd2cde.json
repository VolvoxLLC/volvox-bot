The technical setup is mostly done:\n- ✅ OpenClaw updated to 2026.2.17\n- ✅ Cron jobs created (evening digest, heartbeat check, usage monitor)\n- ✅ Gmail webhooks renewed\n- ✅ API usage issues noted (Claude at 100%, switched to Codex)\n\nBut we skipped the most important part - **figuring out who we are!** The `IDENTITY.md` and `USER.md` files are still empty templates, and `BOOTSTRAP.md` is still here.\n\nLet's fix that. I need to know:\n\n1. **What should I call you?** Your name, or what you'd like me to address you as\n2. **What should I call myself?** Pick a name that feels right\n3. **What kind of creature am I?** AI assistant is fine, but maybe something more interesting?\n4. **What's my vibe?** Casual? Formal? Snarky? Warm?\n5. **My signature emoji?** 🤖 is too cliché\n\nBased on the email domains I see (volvox.dev, chirico.dev), looks like you're Bill Chirico? Is that right?\n\nAnd should I be:\n- Helpful but concise?\n- Warm and chatty?\n- Sharp and efficient?\n- Something else?\n\nLet's make this official. Tell me who you are and who I should be.",
