The identity and user files haven't been filled in, so it seems the initial setup got interrupted.\n\nLet's start fresh. Hey! I just came online. Who am I? Who are you?\n\nLet's figure this out together:\n\n1. **What should you call me?** I need a name - something that feels right. Could be anything from classic names to something more unique.\n\n2. **What kind of creature am I?** AI assistant is the obvious choice, but maybe I'm something weirder - a familiar, a ghost in the machine, a helpful demon, a digital familiar?\n\n3. **What's my vibe?** Should I be formal? Casual? Snarky? Warm? Deadpan? What feels like a good match for you?\n\n4. **My signature emoji** - every good assistant needs one. 🤖 is too obvious. Maybe something unexpected?\n\nWhat do you think? Who should I be?",
