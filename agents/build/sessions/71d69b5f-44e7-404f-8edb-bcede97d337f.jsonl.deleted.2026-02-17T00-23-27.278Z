Follow it exactly.\n> **If you're Pip Build main session:** This documents what sub-agents must do.\n\n## 1. Codesession Tracking (MANDATORY — DO NOT SKIP)\n\nTrack the ENTIRE session — no exceptions. Always use `--json` on every `cs` command.\n**If you skip any of these steps, the session is incomplete and Bill will notice.**\n\n### How It Works (v2.1.0+)\n\nCodesession resolves sessions by **CWD / git root**. As long as each sub-agent runs from its own worktree, parallel sessions just work — no `--session <id>` needed. All commands (`start`, `log-ai`, `note`, `status`, `end`) auto-resolve to the correct session based on your working directory.\n\n### Step-by-step (EVERY sub-agent session):\n\n**FIRST THING — start session FROM THE WORKTREE DIRECTORY:**\n\n```bash\ncd /tmp/bills-bot-<branch>   # MUST be in worktree dir so cs tracks the right git root\ncs start \"task description\" --json\n```\n\n⚠️ If you run `cs start` from the wrong directory, file changes and commits won't be tracked.\n⚠️ `cs start` only blocks if there's already an active session for the same directory/git root.\n\n**After EVERY Claude Code invocation**, log the AI call:\n\n```bash\ncs log-ai -p anthropic -m claude-opus-4-6 --prompt-tokens <n> --completion-tokens <n> --json\n```\n\n⚠️ **THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT STEP.** If you skip `cs log-ai`, the session shows 0 tokens and 0 cost — making it look like nothing happened. Extract token counts from Claude Code output. If you can't get exact numbers, estimate. **NEVER skip this.**\n\n**At every meaningful step** (starting work, reading code, found an issue, making changes, tests passing, pushing, etc.):\n\n```bash\ncs note \"detailed description of what you're doing and why\" --json\n```\n\n**Be verbose** — don't write \"working on memory module\", write \"adding opt-out toggle to /memory command — storing state in Set + JSON persistence, wiring into extractAndStoreMemories skip logic\". Minimum 3-5 notes per session. We need full visibility.\n\n**Before expensive operations** (large refactors, multiple Claude Code calls):\n\n```bash\ncs status --json   # check aiCost field, warn if > $5\n```\n\n**LAST THING you do (after all work is done, pushed, threads resolved):**\n\n```bash\ncs end -n \"detailed summary: files changed, tests added/modified, coverage numbers, commit SHAs, what was done\" --json\n```\n\n### Checklist — verify you did ALL of these:\n\n- [ ] `cd` into worktree BEFORE `cs start`\n- [ ] `cs start` at the very beginning\n- [ ] Stay in the worktree dir for ALL `cs` commands (auto-resolves to correct session)\n- [ ] `cs log-ai` after EVERY AI/Claude Code call (non-negotiable — 0 tokens = broken session)\n- [ ] `cs note` with detailed descriptions at meaningful steps (minimum 3-5 per session)\n- [ ] `cs status` before expensive ops\n- [ ] `cs end` with detailed summary at the very end\n- [ ] Final check: `cs status --json` — verify aiTokens > 0 and filesChanged > 0\n\nRead `skills/codesession/SKILL.md` for full details.\n\n## 2. Claude Code (MANDATORY — NON-NEGOTIABLE)\n\nUse `claude` CLI for ALL programming work. Do NOT hand-write code patches using edit/write tools.\n**ALWAYS use `--model opus`** — Claude Code defaults to Sonnet without it. Opus is required, no exceptions.\n\n```bash\nexec pty:true workdir:<project-dir> command:\"claude --model opus --effort high '<task description>'\"\n```\n\n- **`--model opus --effort high` is REQUIRED on every `claude` invocation** — this is non-negotiable\n- Monitor with `process:log`, don't hand-code patches\n- Agent Teams enabled (`~/.claude/settings.json`) — use for parallel work\n- After Claude Code finishes, log token usage with `cs log-ai`\n- If you write code directly with edit/write tools instead of using `claude` CLI, the session is invalid\n\n## 3. Git Workflow\n\n- **Git worktrees MANDATORY** — NEVER checkout branches in the main repo directory. Always create a worktree:\n  ```bash\n  cd /home/bill/.openclaw/workspace-build/bills-bot\n  git worktree add /tmp/bills-bot-<branch-name> -b <branch-name>\n  cd /tmp/bills-bot-<branch-name>\n  # Do all work here. Clean up when done:\n  git worktree remove /tmp/bills-bot-<branch-name>\n  ```\n  This keeps parallel sub-agents isolated. NON-NEGOTIABLE.\n- **Feature branches only** — never commit directly to main\n- **Conventional commits** — `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`\n- **PRs mandatory** for shared repos\n- **One commit per review comment** on PR review tasks\n- **Check for outdated packages** before every PR (`pnpm outdated`)\n- **80% test coverage mandatory** — statements, branches, functions, lines\n- **Always fix nitpick comments** — unless they don't make sense, would break things, or are redundant\n\n## 4. Board Comments (when task has a board ID)\n\n```bash\n# Start timer BEFORE working:\nvk begin <taskId>\n\n# Comment at EVERY meaningful step (not just start/end):\nvk comment <taskId> \"Starting work — reading codebase\" --author \"Pip Code\"\nvk comment <taskId> \"Found issue in X — applying fix\" --author \"Pip Code\"\nvk comment <taskId> \"Tests passing, committing\" --author \"Pip Code\"\n\n# When done:\nvk done <taskId> \"summary of work\" --author \"Pip Code\"\n```\n\nDo NOT mark a task done until ALL `verificationSteps` are met.\n\n- While executing a board task, keep **subtasks** updated in real time (mark completed ones as checked/done).\n- Keep **done criteria / verificationSteps** updated in real time (check each item as it is verified).\n- Final `vk done` only after subtasks and verificationSteps are accurately checked off.\n- **End-of-task requirement:** before closing, explicitly verify every done-criteria item is both (a) actually completed in the work and (b) marked completed in the board.\n- **Merge Conflict Check:** before finishing, check for merge conflicts with the target branch and fix them if they exist.\n\n## 5. PR Review Thread Resolution\n\nAfter fixing each review comment, resolve the thread on GitHub:\n\n```bash\ngh api graphql -f query='mutation { resolveReviewThread(input: {threadId: \"THREAD_ID\"}) { thread { isResolved } } }'\n```\n\n**⚠️ PAGINATION IS MANDATORY when fetching threads.** GitHub GraphQL `reviewThreads(first:100)` returns max 100 per page. If a PR has 100+ threads, you MUST paginate using `pageInfo{hasNextPage endCursor}` and loop with `after:` cursor. We once missed 22 threads because we only fetched page 1. Use this pattern:\n\n```bash\n# Fetch ALL unresolved threads across all pages\nCURSOR=\"\"\nwhile true; do\n  if [ -z \"$CURSOR\" ]; then\n    QUERY=\"reviewThreads(first:100)\"\n  else\n    QUERY=\"reviewThreads(first:100,after:\\\"$CURSOR\\\")\"\n  fi\n  # ... fetch, collect unresolved threads, check hasNextPage, update CURSOR\n  # Break when hasNextPage is false\ndone\n```\n\nDo **not** post a summary comment on the GitHub PR unless Bill explicitly asks.\n\nInstead, report completion details back to the parent agent (what was fixed, commits, tests, thread resolution), and let the parent agent report to Bill.\n\n- **Merge Conflict Check:** before finishing, check for merge conflicts with the target branch and fix them if they exist.\n\nThis does **not** change board behavior: for board-linked tasks, continue posting verbose board comments (`vk comment ... --author \"Pip Code\"`) and keeping subtasks/done-criteria updated.\n\n## 6. Testing\n\n- Run `pnpm test` — all tests must pass\n- Coverage must stay above 80% on all metrics\n- New code must include tests\n- Use `vitest` — project is already configured\n\n## 7. Code Standards\n\n- **Winston logger only** — NEVER use `console.*` in src/ files (Biome `noConsole: error`)\n- **Keep docs up to date** — README.md, AGENTS.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, .env.example\n- **bills-bot stack:** Node.js ESM, discord.js v14, pnpm, Biome, vitest\n\n## Key Paths\n\n- **bills-bot repo:** `/home/bill/.openclaw/workspace-build/bills-bot/`\n- **Board API:** `http://localhost:3001`\n- **Board CLI:** `vk <command>`\n"}],"isError":false,"timestamp":1771284188606}}

There are 16 unresolved review threads to address, grouped into 7 logical commits. Make ALL changes and commit each group separately with the specified commit message.\n\nIMPORTANT: Read all relevant files first before making changes.\n\n## Commit 1: `fix: wire up postgres transport and prune on startup`\nThread 14: logger.js exports addPostgresTransport but it is never invoked anywhere in src/. Wire it up in src/index.js startup():\n- After DB is initialized (`dbPool = await initDb()`), check if `config.logging?.database?.enabled` is true\n- If so, import and call `addPostgresTransport(dbPool, config.logging.database)` from logger.js\n- Store the transport reference so it can be closed on shutdown\n- In gracefulShutdown(), call `removePostgresTransport(transport)` before closing DB\n\nThread 16: pruneOldLogs is never called at runtime. After initLogsTable (which already runs in db.js), call pruneOldLogs from startup if retentionDays is configured:\n- Import pruneOldLogs from transports/postgres.js  \n- After config loads and if database logging is enabled with retentionDays > 0, call pruneOldLogs(dbPool, retentionDays)\n- Log how many entries were pruned\n\n## Commit 2: `fix: prevent data loss on flush failure and close race`\nThread 6 (postgres.js:91): buffer.splice(0) removes entries BEFORE the async INSERT. If INSERT fails, entries are permanently lost. Fix:\n- Keep a reference to the spliced entries\n- In the catch block, restore them to the front of the buffer (unshift or splice back)\n- This way failed entries get retried on next flush\n\nThread 15 (postgres.js close()): close() can drop buffered entries when flush is already in-flight. Fix:\n- In close(), if this.flushing is true, wait for the in-flight flush to complete before proceeding\n- You can store the flush promise and await it, or use a polling approach\n- After waiting for in-flight flush, do the final flush of any remaining buffer\n\n## Commit 3: `fix: resource leak in removePostgresTransport`\nThread 4 (logger.js:263): removePostgresTransport does NOT call transport.close(). The interval timer keeps running and the buffer is never flushed. Fix:\n- Call `await transport.close()` (or at minimum `transport.close()`) before `logger.remove(transport)`\n- Make the function async since close() is async\n\n## Commit 4: `fix: timestamp format, retentionDays validation, flush safety`\nThread 3 (logger.js:246): The timestamp format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss` lacks timezone info but the column is TIMESTAMPTZ. Fix:\n- Change the winston.format.timestamp format in the PostgresTransport format chain to use ISO 8601: either remove the format option entirely (winston defaults to ISO 8601) or explicitly use `format: \"YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.SSSZ\"`\n\nThread 5 (postgres.js:59): flush() is called fire-and-forget in the setInterval callback and in log(). Add `.catch(() => {})` to prevent unhandled rejection:\n- In the setInterval callback: `this.flush().catch(() => {})`  \n- In the log() method where flush is triggered on batchSize: `this.flush().catch(() => {})`\n\nThread 8 (postgres.js:168): pruneOldLogs doesnt validate retentionDays. Guard against 0, negative, or non-numeric:\n- Add validation at the top of pruneOldLogs\n- If retentionDays is not a positive finite number, throw an error or return 0 early\n\n## Commit 5: `fix: escape ILIKE wildcards, validate level, log query errors`\nThreads 1 & 9 (logQuery.js): ILIKE wildcard characters (%, _) are not escaped in the search parameter. The user could inject wildcards. Fix:\n- Before wrapping in %...%, escape any %, _, and \\ characters in the search string\n- Helper: `str.replace(/\\\\/g, \"\\\\\\\\\").replace(/%/g, \"\\\\%\").replace(/_/g, \"\\\\_\")`\n- Then wrap: `%${escaped}%`\n\nThread 2 (logQuery.js): No validation on the `level` parameter. Someone could pass arbitrary strings. Fix:\n- Define allowed levels: `[\"error\", \"warn\", \"info\", \"debug\"]`\n- If `options.level` is provided but not in the allowed list, either ignore it or throw\n\nThread 10 (logQuery.js:79): Errors are silently swallowed (catch returns empty results without any logging). Fix:\n- Import the logger and log a warning when the DB query fails\n- e.g., `warn(\"Log query failed — database may be unavailable\", { error: err.message })`\n- Avoid importing the default export to prevent circular deps — use named import { warn }\n\n## Commit 6: `fix: combine initLogsTable into transaction`\nThread 7 (postgres.js:145): initLogsTable uses 3 separate queries (CREATE TABLE, CREATE INDEX x2). Combine into a single transaction:\n- Use BEGIN/COMMIT wrapping, or combine all three statements into a single query string separated by semicolons\n- A single `pool.query()` call with all three statements is fine since they are all idempotent DDL\n\n## Commit 7: `test: add concurrent flush, behavioral, and mock helper tests`\nThread 11 (logger.test.js:119): The mock factory for fs/winston-daily-rotate-file/PostgresTransport is repeated in multiple test blocks after vi.resetModules(). Extract to a shared helper function that sets up all three mocks.\n\nThread 12 (logger.test.js:155): Missing behavioral tests for addPostgresTransport and removePostgresTransport. Add tests:\n- Test that addPostgresTransport creates a PostgresTransport and adds it to the logger\n- Test that removePostgresTransport calls transport.close() and removes from logger\n- Test that removePostgresTransport handles null/undefined gracefully\n\nThread 13 (postgres.test.js:258): Missing test for concurrent flush guard (this.flushing flag). Add a test that:\n- Starts a flush (make pool.query return a delayed promise)\n- While first flush is in-flight, calls flush() again\n- Verifies pool.query is only called once (second flush is skipped)\n\nIMPORTANT RULES:\n- Do NOT use console.log/warn/error in src/ files — use the winston logger (import { warn } from \"../logger.js\" etc.)\n- Use conventional commit messages exactly as specified\n- Run `pnpm test` after ALL changes to verify tests pass\n- Make sure each commit only contains the changes for that group\n- The project uses ESM (import/export), NOT CommonJS\n- The project uses vitest for testing' 2>&1","timeout":600,"pty":true}}],"api":"anthropic-messages","provider":"anthropic","model":"claude-opus-4-6","usage":{"input":1,"output":1826,"cacheRead":36136,"cacheWrite":207,"totalTokens":38170,"cost":{"input":0.000005,"output":0.04565,"cacheRead":0.018068,"cacheWrite":0.00129375,"total":0.06501675}},"stopReason":"toolUse","timestamp":1771284249973}}

There are 16 unresolved review threads to address, grouped into 7 logical commits. Make ALL changes and commit each group separately with the specified commit message.\n\nRead ALL relevant files first: src/index.js, src/logger.js, src/transports/postgres.js, src/utils/logQuery.js, src/db.js, tests/logger.test.js, tests/transports/postgres.test.js, tests/utils/logQuery.test.js, config.json\n\n## Commit 1: `fix: wire up postgres transport and prune on startup`\nThread 14: Wire up addPostgresTransport in src/index.js startup(). After DB init and config load, check if config.logging?.database?.enabled is true, then call addPostgresTransport(dbPool, config.logging.database). Store transport reference (let pgTransport) so it can be closed on shutdown via removePostgresTransport.\nThread 16: Call pruneOldLogs from startup if retentionDays is configured and > 0.\n\n## Commit 2: `fix: prevent data loss on flush failure and close race`\nThread 6: In postgres.js flush(), buffer.splice(0) removes entries BEFORE async INSERT. If INSERT fails, entries are permanently lost. Keep reference to spliced entries and restore to buffer front in catch block.\nThread 15: In close(), if this.flushing is true, wait for in-flight flush to complete. Store flush promise, await it before doing final flush.\n\n## Commit 3: `fix: resource leak in removePostgresTransport`\nThread 4: removePostgresTransport doesnt call transport.close(). Make it async, call await transport.close() before logger.remove().\n\n## Commit 4: `fix: timestamp format, retentionDays validation, flush safety`\nThread 3: Change timestamp format in addPostgresTransport format chain to ISO 8601 (remove format option or use YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.SSSZ).\nThread 5: Add .catch(() => {}) to fire-and-forget flush() calls in setInterval and in log() batchSize trigger.\nThread 8: Validate retentionDays in pruneOldLogs - guard against 0, negative, or non-numeric.\n\n## Commit 5: `fix: escape ILIKE wildcards, validate level, log query errors`\nThreads 1 & 9: Escape ILIKE wildcard chars (%, _, \\) in search param before wrapping.\nThread 2: Validate level against allowed list [error, warn, info, debug], ignore if invalid.\nThread 10: Import { warn } from logger and log warning on DB query errors instead of silently swallowing.\n\n## Commit 6: `fix: combine initLogsTable into transaction`\nThread 7: Combine 3 separate queries into single transaction (BEGIN/COMMIT or single query string).\n\n## Commit 7: `test: add concurrent flush, behavioral, and mock helper tests`\nThread 11: Extract repeated mock factory in logger.test.js to shared helper.\nThread 12: Add behavioral tests for addPostgresTransport/removePostgresTransport.\nThread 13: Add test for concurrent flush guard (flushing flag) in postgres.test.js.\n\nRULES:\n- Do NOT use console.log/warn/error in src/ files — use winston logger\n- Use conventional commit messages exactly as specified\n- Run `pnpm test` after ALL changes to verify tests pass\n- Each commit should only contain changes for that group\n- ESM (import/export), NOT CommonJS\n- vitest for testing' 2>&1","timeout":600,"pty":true}}],"api":"anthropic-messages","provider":"anthropic","model":"claude-opus-4-6","usage":{"input":1,"output":990,"cacheRead":125126,"cacheWrite":105,"totalTokens":126222,"cost":{"input":0.000005,"output":0.02475,"cacheRead":0.062563,"cacheWrite":0.00065625,"total":0.08797424999999999}},"stopReason":"toolUse","timestamp":1771284651292}}
