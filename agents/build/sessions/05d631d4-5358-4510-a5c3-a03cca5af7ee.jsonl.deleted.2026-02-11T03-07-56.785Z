Planning is now harder. When intent, scope, or assumptions aren’t clear, teams spend more time re-prompting, reworking, and reviewing than they might have spent writing the code.\r\n\r\nIntroducing\r\n\r\nCodeRabbit Issue Planner\r\n\r\n(Beta)\r\n\r\nIssue Planner ( https://www.coderabbit.ai/issue-planner )\r\nbrings collaborative planning into your issue tracker so teams can align on intent before any code is written.\r\n\r\nUsing CodeRabbit’s context engine, it generates a structured, reviewable\r\nCoding Plan that:\r\n\r\n• Clarifies scope, assumptions, and success criteria\r\n\r\n• Breaks work into agent-ready tasks\r\n\r\n• Pulls in relevant codebase context\r\n\r\n• Allows teams to review and refine the plan together\r\n\r\n• Hands off plan to any AI coding agent in the IDE, CLI, or cloud\r\n\r\nStart using Issue Planner today! ( https://www.coderabbit.ai/issue-planner )\r\n\r\n( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHlgipben70 )\r\n\r\nGet started:\r\n\r\n→ Open an issue in GitHub, GitLab, Jira, or Linear\r\n\r\n→ Check “Create Plan” or comment\r\n@coderabbitai plan\r\n\r\n→ Review, refine, and start building\r\n\r\nPlanning is enabled by default. You can also auto-generate plans using labels like\r\nplan-me\r\nor ready.\r\n\r\n📚 Read the Docs ( https://docs.coderabbit.ai/issues/planning )\r\n\r\n– The CodeRabbit Team\r\n\r\nCodeRabbit, 201 Spear Street Suite 1200, San Francisco, CA 94105\r\n\r\nLinkedIn ( https://www.linkedin.com/company/coderabbitai/ )\r\n\r\nX (Twitter) ( https://x.com/coderabbitai )\r\n\r\nDiscord ( https://discord.gg/coderabbit )\r\n\r\nUnsubscribe ( https://track.customer.io/unsubscribe/dgSbuAsDAPHLlwHwy5cBAZxKj03a1X9-Ygdkc-_-GA== )\r\n | \r\nManage preferences ( https://track.customer.io/manage_subscription_preferences/dgSbuAsDAPHLlwHwy5cBAZxKj03a1X9-Ygdkc-_-GA== )\n\nINSTRUCTIONS: Evaluate this email.
