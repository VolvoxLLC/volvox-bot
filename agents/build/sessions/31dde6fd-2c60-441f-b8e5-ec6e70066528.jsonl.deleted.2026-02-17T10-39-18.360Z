Follow it exactly.\n> **If you're Pip Build main session:** This documents what sub-agents must do.\n\n## 1. Codesession Tracking (MANDATORY — DO NOT SKIP)\n\nTrack the ENTIRE session — no exceptions. Always use `--json` on every `cs` command.\n**If you skip any of these steps, the session is incomplete and Bill will notice.**\n\n### How It Works (v2.1.0+)\n\nCodesession resolves sessions by **CWD / git root**. As long as each sub-agent runs from its own worktree, parallel sessions just work — no `--session <id>` needed. All commands (`start`, `log-ai`, `note`, `status`, `end`) auto-resolve to the correct session based on your working directory.\n\n### Step-by-step (EVERY sub-agent session):\n\n**FIRST THING — start session FROM THE WORKTREE DIRECTORY:**\n\n```bash\ncd /tmp/bills-bot-<branch>   # MUST be in worktree dir so cs tracks the right git root\ncs start \"task description\" --json\n```\n\n⚠️ If you run `cs start` from the wrong directory, file changes and commits won't be tracked.\n⚠️ `cs start` only blocks if there's already an active session for the same directory/git root.\n\n**After EVERY Claude Code invocation**, log the AI call:\n\n```bash\ncs log-ai -p anthropic -m claude-opus-4-6 --prompt-tokens <n> --completion-tokens <n> --json\n```\n\n⚠️ **THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT STEP.** If you skip `cs log-ai`, the session shows 0 tokens and 0 cost — making it look like nothing happened. Extract token counts from Claude Code output. If you can't get exact numbers, estimate. **NEVER skip this.**\n\n**At every meaningful step** (starting work, reading code, found an issue, making changes, tests passing, pushing, etc.):\n\n```bash\ncs note \"detailed description of what you're doing and why\" --json\n```\n\n**Be verbose** — don't write \"working on memory module\", write \"adding opt-out toggle to /memory command — storing state in Set + JSON persistence, wiring into extractAndStoreMemories skip logic\". Minimum 3-5 notes per session. We need full visibility.\n\n**Before expensive operations** (large refactors, multiple Claude Code calls):\n\n```bash\ncs status --json   # check aiCost field, warn if > $5\n```\n\n**LAST THING you do (after all work is done, pushed, threads resolved):**\n\n```bash\ncs end -n \"detailed summary: files changed, tests added/modified, coverage numbers, commit SHAs, what was done\" --json\n```\n\n### Checklist — verify you did ALL of these:\n\n- [ ] `cd` into worktree BEFORE `cs start`\n- [ ] `cs start` at the very beginning\n- [ ] Stay in the worktree dir for ALL `cs` commands (auto-resolves to correct session)\n- [ ] `cs log-ai` after EVERY AI/Claude Code call (non-negotiable — 0 tokens = broken session)\n- [ ] `cs note` with detailed descriptions at meaningful steps (minimum 3-5 per session)\n- [ ] `cs status` before expensive ops\n- [ ] `cs end` with detailed summary at the very end\n- [ ] Final check: `cs status --json` — verify aiTokens > 0 and filesChanged > 0\n\nRead `skills/codesession/SKILL.md` for full details.\n\n## 2. Claude Code (MANDATORY — NON-NEGOTIABLE)\n\nUse `claude` CLI for ALL programming work. Do NOT hand-write code patches using edit/write tools.\n**ALWAYS use `--model opus`** — Claude Code defaults to Sonnet without it. Opus is required, no exceptions.\n\n```bash\nexec pty:true workdir:<project-dir> command:\"claude --model opus --effort high --dangerously-skip-permissions '<task description>'\"\n```\n\n- **`--model opus --effort high --dangerously-skip-permissions` is REQUIRED on every `claude` invocation** — this is non-negotiable\n- Monitor with `process:log`, don't hand-code patches\n- Agent Teams enabled (`~/.claude/settings.json`) — use for parallel work\n- After Claude Code finishes, log token usage with `cs log-ai`\n- If you write code directly with edit/write tools instead of using `claude` CLI, the session is invalid\n\n## 3. Git Workflow\n\n- **Git worktrees MANDATORY** — NEVER checkout branches in the main repo directory. Always create a worktree:\n  ```bash\n  cd /home/bill/.openclaw/workspace-build/bills-bot\n  git worktree add /tmp/bills-bot-<branch-name> -b <branch-name>\n  cd /tmp/bills-bot-<branch-name>\n  # Do all work here. Clean up when done:\n  git worktree remove /tmp/bills-bot-<branch-name>\n  ```\n  This keeps parallel sub-agents isolated. NON-NEGOTIABLE.\n- **Feature branches only** — never commit directly to main\n- **Conventional commits** — `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`\n- **PRs mandatory** for shared repos\n- **One commit per review comment** on PR review tasks\n- **Check for outdated packages** before every PR (`pnpm outdated`)\n- **80% test coverage mandatory** — statements, branches, functions, lines\n- **Always fix nitpick comments** — unless they don't make sense, would break things, or are redundant\n\n## 4. Board Comments (when task has a board ID)\n\n```bash\n# Start timer BEFORE working:\nvk begin <taskId>\n\n# Comment at EVERY meaningful step (not just start/end):\nvk comment <taskId> \"Starting work — reading codebase\" --author \"Pip Code\"\nvk comment <taskId> \"Found issue in X — applying fix\" --author \"Pip Code\"\nvk comment <taskId> \"Tests passing, committing\" --author \"Pip Code\"\n\n# When done:\nvk done <taskId> \"summary of work\" --author \"Pip Code\"\n```\n\nDo NOT mark a task done until ALL `verificationSteps` are met.\n\n- While executing a board task, keep **subtasks** updated in real time (mark completed ones as checked/done).\n- Keep **done criteria / verificationSteps** updated in real time (check each item as it is verified).\n- Final `vk done` only after subtasks and verificationSteps are accurately checked off.\n- **End-of-task requirement:** before closing, explicitly verify every done-criteria item is both (a) actually completed in the work and (b) marked completed in the board.\n- **Merge Conflict Check:** before finishing, check for merge conflicts with the target branch and fix them if they exist.\n\n## 5. PR Review Thread Resolution\n\nAfter fixing each review comment, resolve the thread on GitHub:\n\n```bash\ngh api graphql -f query='mutation { resolveReviewThread(input: {threadId: \"THREAD_ID\"}) { thread { isResolved } } }'\n```\n\n**⚠️ PAGINATION IS MANDATORY when fetching threads.** GitHub GraphQL `reviewThreads(first:100)` returns max 100 per page. If a PR has 100+ threads, you MUST paginate using `pageInfo{hasNextPage endCursor}` and loop with `after:` cursor. We once missed 22 threads because we only fetched page 1. Use this pattern:\n\n```bash\n# Fetch ALL unresolved threads across all pages\nCURSOR=\"\"\nwhile true; do\n  if [ -z \"$CURSOR\" ]; then\n    QUERY=\"reviewThreads(first:100)\"\n  else\n    QUERY=\"reviewThreads(first:100,after:\\\"$CURSOR\\\")\"\n  fi\n  # ... fetch, collect unresolved threads, check hasNextPage, update CURSOR\n  # Break when hasNextPage is false\ndone\n```\n\nDo **not** post a summary comment on the GitHub PR unless Bill explicitly asks.\n\nInstead, report completion details back to the parent agent (what was fixed, commits, tests, thread resolution), and let the parent agent report to Bill.\n\n- **Merge Conflict Check:** before finishing, check for merge conflicts with the target branch and fix them if they exist.\n\nThis does **not** change board behavior: for board-linked tasks, continue posting verbose board comments (`vk comment ... --author \"Pip Code\"`) and keeping subtasks/done-criteria updated.\n\n## 6. Testing\n\n- Run `pnpm test` — all tests must pass\n- Coverage must stay above 80% on all metrics\n- New code must include tests\n- Use `vitest` — project is already configured\n\n## 7. Code Standards\n\n- **Winston logger only** — NEVER use `console.*` in src/ files (Biome `noConsole: error`)\n- **Keep docs up to date** — README.md, AGENTS.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, .env.example\n- **bills-bot stack:** Node.js ESM, discord.js v14, pnpm, Biome, vitest\n\n## Key Paths\n\n- **bills-bot repo:** `/home/bill/.openclaw/workspace-build/bills-bot/`\n- **Board API:** `http://localhost:3001`\n- **Board CLI:** `vk <command>`\n"}],"isError":false,"timestamp":1771321114793}}

Access-Control-Allow-Headers header is only sent inside the      [39m[49m    \r[1B[48;5;237m[38;5;231m  OPTIONS block (line 38-39). Browsers also need this header on the actual response for non-simple headers like     \r[1B  x-api-secret. Move `res.set(\"Access-Control-Allow-Headers\", \"Content-Type, x-api-secret\")` outside the OPTIONS    [39m[49m    \r[1B[48;5;237m[38;5;231m  block so it is set on ALL responses, not just OPTIONS preflight. Keep the OPTIONS 204 response. Make a single     [39m[49m  \r\r\n[48;5;237m[38;5;231m  focused change.
