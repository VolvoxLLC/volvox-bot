This also means variables you reference “above” the mock in the file may be unavailable unless you place them in `vi.hoisted(...)`. [1]  \\n- **Hoisting scope/limitations**: Vitest only hoists `vi.mock`/`vi.hoisted` **in test files (and setup files)**—not inside modules you import. This can lead to “why didn’t my mock hoist?” surprises if you wrap mocks in helpers located in other files. [3]  \\n- **Mock factory caching**: If you provide a factory to `vi.mock(module, factory)`, Vitest calls that factory **once** and caches its result for later imports until you `vi.unmock` / `vi.doUnmock`. [1]  \\n- **`vi.resetModules()` behavior**: `vi.resetModules()` clears the **module cache/registry** so future *dynamic* imports (`await import(...)`) re-evaluate modules, but it **cannot re-evaluate top-level static imports** already executed, and it **does not clear the mocks registry** (use `unmock/doUnmock` for that). [1]  \\n- **Common pattern for “setup file imported too early”**: Modules imported in a setup file may already be cached by the time the test runs; Vitest explicitly notes you can call `vi.resetModules()` inside `vi.hoisted(...)` to clear caches **before** the test file executes. [1]  \\n\\n**Sources:** Vitest `vi` API (mock hoisting, `vi.hoisted`, `vi.resetModules`, caching, setup-file caching note) [1]; Vitest experimental/config note on what gets hoisted and where [3].\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n\\n</details>\\n\\n**Remove the `vi.mock()` calls from `beforeEach`—they conflict with top-level mocks.**\\n\\nWhile `vi.mock()` is hoisted by Vitest and does apply globally, calling it again inside `beforeEach` creates a conflict. Top-level mocks (lines 9–25) are registered at the file scope. Calling `vi.mock()` again in `beforeEach` (lines 32–44) will be hoisted and attempt to re-register the same mocks, which can cause unexpected behavior or error.\\n\\nThe correct pattern used elsewhere in the codebase is to call `vi.resetModules()` alone in `beforeEach`, then rely on the top-level mocks. If you need different mock behavior per test, use `vi.doMock()` (non-hoisted) within individual `it()` blocks instead.\\n\\n<details>\\n<summary>🤖 Prompt for AI Agents</summary>\\n\\n```\\nVerify each finding against the current code and only fix it if needed.\\n\\nIn `@tests/modules/config-guild.test.js` around lines 30 - 44, The beforeEach\\nblock incorrectly re-registers hoisted mocks by calling vi.mock() again; remove\\nthe vi.mock(...) calls inside beforeEach and keep only vi.resetModules() so the\\ntop-level mocks remain in effect, and if you need per-test variants use\\nvi.doMock() within individual it() blocks instead; update the beforeEach that\\ncontains beforeEach, vi.resetModules, and vi.mock(...) to only call\\nvi.resetModules().\\n```\\n\\n</details>\\n\\n<!-- fingerprinting:phantom:medusa:phoenix -->\\n\\n<!-- This is an auto-generated comment by CodeRabbit -->\",\"createdAt\":\"2026-02-17T22:18:46Z\"}]}},{\"id\":\"PRRT_kwDORICdSM5vKUV8\",\"isResolved\":false,\"path\":\"tests/modules/config-guild.test.js\",\"line\":238,\"originalLine\":238,\"comments\":{\"nodes\":[{\"author\":{\"login\":\"coderabbitai\"},\"body\":\"_🧹 Nitpick_ | _🔵 Trivial_\\n\\n**Prototype pollution tests verify end-to-end safety but don't directly exercise `deepMerge`'s `DANGEROUS_KEYS` filtering.**\\n\\nSince the global config lacks an `ai.threadMode` key, `deepMerge` takes the `structuredClone` branch (line 73 of config.js) for `threadMode` rather than recursing into it.

This also means variables you reference “above” the mock in the file may be unavailable unless you place them in `vi.hoisted(...)`. [1]  \\n- **Hoisting scope/limitations**: Vitest only hoists `vi.mock`/`vi.hoisted` **in test files (and setup files)**—not inside modules you import. This can lead to “why didn’t my mock hoist?” surprises if you wrap mocks in helpers located in other files. [3]  \\n- **Mock factory caching**: If you provide a factory to `vi.mock(module, factory)`, Vitest calls that factory **once** and caches its result for later imports until you `vi.unmock` / `vi.doUnmock`. [1]  \\n- **`vi.resetModules()` behavior**: `vi.resetModules()` clears the **module cache/registry** so future *dynamic* imports (`await import(...)`) re-evaluate modules, but it **cannot re-evaluate top-level static imports** already executed, and it **does not clear the mocks registry** (use `unmock/doUnmock` for that). [1]  \\n- **Common pattern for “setup file imported too early”**: Modules imported in a setup file may already be cached by the time the test runs; Vitest explicitly notes you can call `vi.resetModules()` inside `vi.hoisted(...)` to clear caches **before** the test file executes. [1]  \\n\\n**Sources:** Vitest `vi` API (mock hoisting, `vi.hoisted`, `vi.resetModules`, caching, setup-file caching note) [1]; Vitest experimental/config note on what gets hoisted and where [3].\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n\\n</details>\\n\\n**Remove the `vi.mock()` calls from `beforeEach`—they conflict with top-level mocks.**\\n\\nWhile `vi.mock()` is hoisted by Vitest and does apply globally, calling it again inside `beforeEach` creates a conflict. Top-level mocks (lines 9–25) are registered at the file scope. Calling `vi.mock()` again in `beforeEach` (lines 32–44) will be hoisted and attempt to re-register the same mocks, which can cause unexpected behavior or error.\\n\\nThe correct pattern used elsewhere in the codebase is to call `vi.resetModules()` alone in `beforeEach`, then rely on the top-level mocks. If you need different mock behavior per test, use `vi.doMock()` (non-hoisted) within individual `it()` blocks instead.\\n\\n<details>\\n<summary>🤖 Prompt for AI Agents</summary>\\n\\n```\\nVerify each finding against the current code and only fix it if needed.\\n\\nIn `@tests/modules/config-guild.test.js` around lines 30 - 44, The beforeEach\\nblock incorrectly re-registers hoisted mocks by calling vi.mock() again; remove\\nthe vi.mock(...) calls inside beforeEach and keep only vi.resetModules() so the\\ntop-level mocks remain in effect, and if you need per-test variants use\\nvi.doMock() within individual it() blocks instead; update the beforeEach that\\ncontains beforeEach, vi.resetModules, and vi.mock(...) to only call\\nvi.resetModules().\\n```\\n\\n</details>\\n\\n<!-- fingerprinting:phantom:medusa:phoenix -->\\n\\n<!-- This is an auto-generated comment by CodeRabbit -->\",\"createdAt\":\"2026-02-17T22:18:46Z\"}]}},{\"id\":\"PRRT_kwDORICdSM5vKUV8\",\"isResolved\":false,\"path\":\"tests/modules/config-guild.test.js\",\"line\":238,\"originalLine\":238,\"comments\":{\"nodes\":[{\"author\":{\"login\":\"coderabbitai\"},\"body\":\"_🧹 Nitpick_ | _🔵 Trivial_\\n\\n**Prototype pollution tests verify end-to-end safety but don't directly exercise `deepMerge`'s `DANGEROUS_KEYS` filtering.**\\n\\nSince the global config lacks an `ai.threadMode` key, `deepMerge` takes the `structuredClone` branch (line 73 of config.js) for `threadMode` rather than recursing into it.

OWASP explicitly calls out this risk pattern and notes how Node’s `jsonwebtoken` API shape can make this mistake easy if you don’t pin algorithms. [1]\\n\\nSeparately, `jsonwebtoken` (npm) **did have** a real verification bypass: **versions ≤ 8.5.1** could accept **unsigned** tokens in a specific scenario (no `algorithms` specified + a **falsy** key/secret), due to defaulting to `none`; this was **patched in 9.0.0** (removing default support for `none`). [2]\\n\\nAlso, people often mix up `jsonwebtoken` with the similarly named package `json-web-token` (npm), which has a published advisory for an **algorithm-confusion vulnerability** (CVE-2023-48238 / GHSA-4xw9-cx39-r355). [3]\\n\\n**What to do (for `jsonwebtoken`):**\\n- **Upgrade to `jsonwebtoken` ≥ 9.0.0**. [2]\\n- In `jwt.verify`, **explicitly whitelist algorithms** (e.g. only `['RS256']`) rather than relying on defaults. [1]\\n- Don’t allow both **HS\\\\*** and **RS\\\\***/**ES\\\\*** for the same verifier, and don’t reuse/publicly expose key material in a way that could be misused as an HMAC secret (the classic RS256→HS256 confusion condition).

This means Discord access tokens persist indefinitely after \\\"logout,\\\" and a compromised JWT remains usable for guild admin verification until its 1-hour expiry.\\n<!-- DESCRIPTION END -->\\n\\n<!-- BUGBOT_BUG_ID: b20129a5-9f1c-4b6b-ae58-701eff7fab27 -->\\n\\n<!-- LOCATIONS START\\nsrc/api/routes/auth.js#L202-L205\\nLOCATIONS END -->\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://cursor.com/open?data=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCIsImtpZCI6ImJ1Z2JvdC12MiJ9.eyJ2ZXJzaW9uIjoxLCJ0eXBlIjoiQlVHQk9UX0ZJWF9JTl9DVVJTT1IiLCJkYXRhIjp7InJlZGlzS2V5IjoiYnVnYm90OjdmYmY5Y2I0LTEwZTQtNGVjNC1hZDlmLTRmZjFhYmQ2N2E0ZSIsImVuY3J5cHRpb25LZXkiOiJpQWhma1hITy1rTVZLdFl2RlNXWGwwd1FDVjJNOTVINW1ZWEsta2dVMHAwIiwiYnJhbmNoIjoiZmVhdC9ndWlsZC1hZG1pbi1hdXRoIiwicmVwb093bmVyIjoiQmlsbENoaXJpY28iLCJyZXBvTmFtZSI6ImJpbGxzLWJvdCJ9LCJpYXQiOjE3NzEzNDc4NjYsImV4cCI6MTc3MzkzOTg2Nn0.h8K97YQIyLQcoGUQcRBly9hpyBtQAAyVd9BRqan6J8xqcVsHX80XRA7K-jR5XOnDtI8naWYSIdj_po9ICkRKRNaOK7ry0HvTehZEZZ5Pz7c1IaN0zQVbtOKnMDp3xNJsCJ4SYcXllpQcF4zvZs3vu9vshoGNoaUtSDHcceJX2cfXsF523FqflSiB6yKx_nXot8HHcHqQ15T4uyQGomXotv7PyF1TwPm52faSrj-YMAehiBI-FZPPZjE4u_JSTV4CXVKGu1KbEkh7BklRiwiX48AZbR4ZmO6yGHppcZGKmqWDNQAPa0XBvkA-CZkiyY-qy8Hfp6A8DmOsLxnrtln2hw\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\"><picture><source media=\\\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\\\" srcset=\\\"https://cursor.com/assets/images/fix-in-cursor-dark.png\\\"><source media=\\\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\\\" srcset=\\\"https://cursor.com/assets/images/fix-in-cursor-light.png\\\"><img alt=\\\"Fix in Cursor\\\" width=\\\"115\\\" height=\\\"28\\\" src=\\\"https://cursor.com/assets/images/fix-in-cursor-dark.png\\\"></picture></a>&nbsp;<a href=\\\"https://cursor.com/agents?data=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCIsImtpZCI6ImJ1Z2JvdC12MiJ9.eyJ2ZXJzaW9uIjoxLCJ0eXBlIjoiQlVHQk9UX0ZJWF9JTl9XRUIiLCJkYXRhIjp7InJlZGlzS2V5IjoiYnVnYm90OjdmYmY5Y2I0LTEwZTQtNGVjNC1hZDlmLTRmZjFhYmQ2N2E0ZSIsImVuY3J5cHRpb25LZXkiOiJpQWhma1hITy1rTVZLdFl2RlNXWGwwd1FDVjJNOTVINW1ZWEsta2dVMHAwIiwiYnJhbmNoIjoiZmVhdC9ndWlsZC1hZG1pbi1hdXRoIiwicmVwb093bmVyIjoiQmlsbENoaXJpY28iLCJyZXBvTmFtZSI6ImJpbGxzLWJvdCIsInByTnVtYmVyIjo3MywiY29tbWl0U2hhIjoiZTAzNzMwMjQ4YmM4YTk0NjI5YTE4N2E0ZTQ2OTkzMmEzMWIwMmU3OCIsInByb3ZpZGVyIjoiZ2l0aHViIn0sImlhdCI6MTc3MTM0Nzg2NiwiZXhwIjoxNzczOTM5ODY2fQ.g46vSXO6nwEtBQjgVGAhakcxoRLDNoOirO77NaIMSaEm2eZQzp55z6refKxYOQLu92zSrL3MaB1IY93FND0hZ8LxowrgVqWv7meWeznSsHu8f80fmU1Lra3Hse-RAPr7yy_uI4BCOYqbugBEls2so49k2MkKG0_fcoBw36N6C_Wi67s5xyigja9zJIeZIyG9f4LFpo8F7DGXF95ESQCn4JXwhCzFgweIMecQ-RuNRgtqZ04cWsvsPpZaZ38AUQSFQKfW4MFOOx9Faj6laf5ikeD9udRKEeZo-658638ymuFwNa_hrpwDeteT3jYYxd50yto8saiYiCDEbGHrD0bYLw\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\"><picture><source media=\\\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\\\" srcset=\\\"https://cursor.com/assets/images/fix-in-web-dark.png\\\"><source media=\\\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\\\" srcset=\\\"https://cursor.com/assets/images/fix-in-web-light.png\\\"><img alt=\\\"Fix in Web\\\" width=\\\"99\\\" height=\\\"28\\\" src=\\\"https://cursor.com/assets/images/fix-in-web-dark.png\\\"></picture></a></p>\\n\\n\",\"createdAt\":\"2026-02-17T17:04:26Z\"}]}},{\"id\":\"PRRT_kwDORICdSM5vG2YT\",\"isResolved\":true,\"path\":\"src/api/routes/auth.js\",\"line\":null,\"originalLine\":91,\"comments\":{\"nodes\":[{\"author\":{\"login\":\"claude\"},\"body\":\"🟡 **Warning: `stopSessionCleanup` is exported but never called during shutdown**\\n\\n`stopAuthCleanup()` is called in `server.js:126` during `stopServer()`, but it only clears the `stateCleanupInterval`.

OWASP explicitly calls out this risk pattern and notes how Node’s `jsonwebtoken` API shape can make this mistake easy if you don’t pin algorithms. [1]\\n\\nSeparately, `jsonwebtoken` (npm) **did have** a real verification bypass: **versions ≤ 8.5.1** could accept **unsigned** tokens in a specific scenario (no `algorithms` specified + a **falsy** key/secret), due to defaulting to `none`; this was **patched in 9.0.0** (removing default support for `none`). [2]\\n\\nAlso, people often mix up `jsonwebtoken` with the similarly named package `json-web-token` (npm), which has a published advisory for an **algorithm-confusion vulnerability** (CVE-2023-48238 / GHSA-4xw9-cx39-r355). [3]\\n\\n**What to do (for `jsonwebtoken`):**\\n- **Upgrade to `jsonwebtoken` ≥ 9.0.0**. [2]\\n- In `jwt.verify`, **explicitly whitelist algorithms** (e.g. only `['RS256']`) rather than relying on defaults. [1]\\n- Don’t allow both **HS\\\\*** and **RS\\\\***/**ES\\\\*** for the same verifier, and don’t reuse/publicly expose key material in a way that could be misused as an HMAC secret (the classic RS256→HS256 confusion condition).

The access token would be better stored server-side (e.g., in a database keyed by user ID) with only an opaque reference in the JWT.\\n<!-- DESCRIPTION END -->\\n\\n<!-- BUGBOT_BUG_ID: a04e1281-541f-4119-9f4a-ecf516906d56 -->\\n\\n<!-- LOCATIONS START\\nsrc/api/routes/auth.js#L125-L136\\nsrc/api/routes/guilds.js#L78-L89\\nLOCATIONS END -->\\n<details>\\n<summary>Additional Locations (1)</summary>\\n\\n- [`src/api/routes/guilds.js#L78-L89`](https://github.com/BillChirico/bills-bot/blob/38feff0e4995f3bab70de6e2554766624c17e8d6/src/api/routes/guilds.js#L78-L89)\\n\\n</details>\\n\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://cursor.com/open?data=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCIsImtpZCI6ImJ1Z2JvdC12MiJ9.eyJ2ZXJzaW9uIjoxLCJ0eXBlIjoiQlVHQk9UX0ZJWF9JTl9DVVJTT1IiLCJkYXRhIjp7InJlZGlzS2V5IjoiYnVnYm90OjllZjYxOGJlLTliNGYtNDI5OS1iNGJhLWY0ZDNiOGNhY2Y3YyIsImVuY3J5cHRpb25LZXkiOiJQd0tTNzFwSndoX2wtR0tuWldyWTF1NUdHY2hHUnlIMnFlYlR6Y1BYbVVNIiwiYnJhbmNoIjoiZmVhdC9ndWlsZC1hZG1pbi1hdXRoIiwicmVwb093bmVyIjoiQmlsbENoaXJpY28iLCJyZXBvTmFtZSI6ImJpbGxzLWJvdCJ9LCJpYXQiOjE3NzEzNDcyMTYsImV4cCI6MTc3MzkzOTIxNn0.GAXEW00hGwSkTo4WOWvYGBNH7gWEHLlJR6P4zOQbTsoQf5xzF4UeeJYA11_kmvZnLBRgoCBKQes5GTCP8TMbtOsTFc_1DJIDy6oXmSjSvaDhi_Odqz_9BWniIbFVeDMs7cIpoEOe-NahRemCczEeae1gnr5xT_fl7ESjm_4ushwkNswKE0x-qa9LTAipGHQdKYKYsfstOAlDzxtVqs0aBDm6Y06pRtTk6DWCd4CVYLc5TJDafGNYaSN8Ku5WHbjJKxutvcRou9Y0PN7E9hQzpnj5TAV-E7Qsuic2hYzxTgm1KZDcXI-C1zFIKnWQHbA53XuUQB0IQVuGEnge1SVNPw\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\"><picture><source media=\\\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\\\" srcset=\\\"https://cursor.com/assets/images/fix-in-cursor-dark.png\\\"><source media=\\\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\\\" srcset=\\\"https://cursor.com/assets/images/fix-in-cursor-light.png\\\"><img alt=\\\"Fix in Cursor\\\" width=\\\"115\\\" height=\\\"28\\\" src=\\\"https://cursor.com/assets/images/fix-in-cursor-dark.png\\\"></picture></a>&nbsp;<a href=\\\"https://cursor.com/agents?data=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCIsImtpZCI6ImJ1Z2JvdC12MiJ9.eyJ2ZXJzaW9uIjoxLCJ0eXBlIjoiQlVHQk9UX0ZJWF9JTl9XRUIiLCJkYXRhIjp7InJlZGlzS2V5IjoiYnVnYm90OjllZjYxOGJlLTliNGYtNDI5OS1iNGJhLWY0ZDNiOGNhY2Y3YyIsImVuY3J5cHRpb25LZXkiOiJQd0tTNzFwSndoX2wtR0tuWldyWTF1NUdHY2hHUnlIMnFlYlR6Y1BYbVVNIiwiYnJhbmNoIjoiZmVhdC9ndWlsZC1hZG1pbi1hdXRoIiwicmVwb093bmVyIjoiQmlsbENoaXJpY28iLCJyZXBvTmFtZSI6ImJpbGxzLWJvdCIsInByTnVtYmVyIjo3MywiY29tbWl0U2hhIjoiMzhmZWZmMGU0OTk1ZjNiYWI3MGRlNmUyNTU0NzY2NjI0YzE3ZThkNiIsInByb3ZpZGVyIjoiZ2l0aHViIn0sImlhdCI6MTc3MTM0NzIxNiwiZXhwIjoxNzczOTM5MjE2fQ.sotvdrTcr2qTAKAnPoWbUWn174sdOvvcetcXmlQdzBnI1dWMdiztCfpUZxkAEMMCk2-tFs_HfYf8f5I8tdMOoUuib6Upm-ly6-Jqet6KPZhA4QWSxaw99vr3Z43-jBUBNaDlZCth_v-EZ2kpzTUpZu-5nZjbd5KFmPwEeo1GTEYem7yvWyPfryRtODT7TDSY_n5vmH8cLE_HWdZsaqXX4oK-p4bP9jPVZ-hbNzS0k9PVIab3sKCSYLTog5fmeh0AjkaLYmhDqd9cxtEg3owRMZz6dE1nAq_r9sbhRmYX7w-kYZBO5eiUFWDCrm_vKz1I_dra4A-WS2ryIwjZwQhqxQ\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\"><picture><source media=\\\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\\\" srcset=\\\"https://cursor.com/assets/images/fix-in-web-dark.png\\\"><source media=\\\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\\\" srcset=\\\"https://cursor.com/assets/images/fix-in-web-light.png\\\"><img alt=\\\"Fix in Web\\\" width=\\\"99\\\" height=\\\"28\\\" src=\\\"https://cursor.com/assets/images/fix-in-web-dark.png\\\"></picture></a></p>\\n\\n\",\"createdAt\":\"2026-02-17T16:53:37Z\"}]}},{\"id\":\"PRRT_kwDORICdSM5vGhC5\",\"isResolved\":true,\"path\":\"src/api/middleware/auth.js\",\"line\":74,\"originalLine\":72,\"comments\":{\"nodes\":[{\"author\":{\"login\":\"cursor\"},\"body\":\"### Duplicate JWT verification with inconsistent error status\\n\\n**Medium Severity**\\n\\n<!-- DESCRIPTION START -->\\nJWT verification logic is duplicated between `requireAuth` in `auth.js` and `requireOAuth` in `oauth.js`, and they handle the missing `SESSION_SECRET` case differently: `requireAuth` returns 401, while `requireOAuth` correctly returns 500.

This means Discord access tokens persist indefinitely after \\\"logout,\\\" and a compromised JWT remains usable for guild admin verification until its 1-hour expiry.\\n<!-- DESCRIPTION END -->\\n\\n<!-- BUGBOT_BUG_ID: b20129a5-9f1c-4b6b-ae58-701eff7fab27 -->\\n\\n<!-- LOCATIONS START\\nsrc/api/routes/auth.js#L202-L205\\nLOCATIONS END -->\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://cursor.com/open?data=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCIsImtpZCI6ImJ1Z2JvdC12MiJ9.eyJ2ZXJzaW9uIjoxLCJ0eXBlIjoiQlVHQk9UX0ZJWF9JTl9DVVJTT1IiLCJkYXRhIjp7InJlZGlzS2V5IjoiYnVnYm90OjdmYmY5Y2I0LTEwZTQtNGVjNC1hZDlmLTRmZjFhYmQ2N2E0ZSIsImVuY3J5cHRpb25LZXkiOiJpQWhma1hITy1rTVZLdFl2RlNXWGwwd1FDVjJNOTVINW1ZWEsta2dVMHAwIiwiYnJhbmNoIjoiZmVhdC9ndWlsZC1hZG1pbi1hdXRoIiwicmVwb093bmVyIjoiQmlsbENoaXJpY28iLCJyZXBvTmFtZSI6ImJpbGxzLWJvdCJ9LCJpYXQiOjE3NzEzNDc4NjYsImV4cCI6MTc3MzkzOTg2Nn0.h8K97YQIyLQcoGUQcRBly9hpyBtQAAyVd9BRqan6J8xqcVsHX80XRA7K-jR5XOnDtI8naWYSIdj_po9ICkRKRNaOK7ry0HvTehZEZZ5Pz7c1IaN0zQVbtOKnMDp3xNJsCJ4SYcXllpQcF4zvZs3vu9vshoGNoaUtSDHcceJX2cfXsF523FqflSiB6yKx_nXot8HHcHqQ15T4uyQGomXotv7PyF1TwPm52faSrj-YMAehiBI-FZPPZjE4u_JSTV4CXVKGu1KbEkh7BklRiwiX48AZbR4ZmO6yGHppcZGKmqWDNQAPa0XBvkA-CZkiyY-qy8Hfp6A8DmOsLxnrtln2hw\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\"><picture><source media=\\\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\\\" srcset=\\\"https://cursor.com/assets/images/fix-in-cursor-dark.png\\\"><source media=\\\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\\\" srcset=\\\"https://cursor.com/assets/images/fix-in-cursor-light.png\\\"><img alt=\\\"Fix in Cursor\\\" width=\\\"115\\\" height=\\\"28\\\" src=\\\"https://cursor.com/assets/images/fix-in-cursor-dark.png\\\"></picture></a>&nbsp;<a href=\\\"https://cursor.com/agents?data=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCIsImtpZCI6ImJ1Z2JvdC12MiJ9.eyJ2ZXJzaW9uIjoxLCJ0eXBlIjoiQlVHQk9UX0ZJWF9JTl9XRUIiLCJkYXRhIjp7InJlZGlzS2V5IjoiYnVnYm90OjdmYmY5Y2I0LTEwZTQtNGVjNC1hZDlmLTRmZjFhYmQ2N2E0ZSIsImVuY3J5cHRpb25LZXkiOiJpQWhma1hITy1rTVZLdFl2RlNXWGwwd1FDVjJNOTVINW1ZWEsta2dVMHAwIiwiYnJhbmNoIjoiZmVhdC9ndWlsZC1hZG1pbi1hdXRoIiwicmVwb093bmVyIjoiQmlsbENoaXJpY28iLCJyZXBvTmFtZSI6ImJpbGxzLWJvdCIsInByTnVtYmVyIjo3MywiY29tbWl0U2hhIjoiZTAzNzMwMjQ4YmM4YTk0NjI5YTE4N2E0ZTQ2OTkzMmEzMWIwMmU3OCIsInByb3ZpZGVyIjoiZ2l0aHViIn0sImlhdCI6MTc3MTM0Nzg2NiwiZXhwIjoxNzczOTM5ODY2fQ.g46vSXO6nwEtBQjgVGAhakcxoRLDNoOirO77NaIMSaEm2eZQzp55z6refKxYOQLu92zSrL3MaB1IY93FND0hZ8LxowrgVqWv7meWeznSsHu8f80fmU1Lra3Hse-RAPr7yy_uI4BCOYqbugBEls2so49k2MkKG0_fcoBw36N6C_Wi67s5xyigja9zJIeZIyG9f4LFpo8F7DGXF95ESQCn4JXwhCzFgweIMecQ-RuNRgtqZ04cWsvsPpZaZ38AUQSFQKfW4MFOOx9Faj6laf5ikeD9udRKEeZo-658638ymuFwNa_hrpwDeteT3jYYxd50yto8saiYiCDEbGHrD0bYLw\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\"><picture><source media=\\\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\\\" srcset=\\\"https://cursor.com/assets/images/fix-in-web-dark.png\\\"><source media=\\\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\\\" srcset=\\\"https://cursor.com/assets/images/fix-in-web-light.png\\\"><img alt=\\\"Fix in Web\\\" width=\\\"99\\\" height=\\\"28\\\" src=\\\"https://cursor.com/assets/images/fix-in-web-dark.png\\\"></picture></a></p>\\n\\n\",\"createdAt\":\"2026-02-17T17:04:26Z\"}]}},{\"id\":\"PRRT_kwDORICdSM5vG2YT\",\"isResolved\":true,\"path\":\"src/api/routes/auth.js\",\"line\":null,\"originalLine\":91,\"comments\":{\"nodes\":[{\"author\":{\"login\":\"claude\"},\"body\":\"🟡 **Warning: `stopSessionCleanup` is exported but never called during shutdown**\\n\\n`stopAuthCleanup()` is called in `server.js:126` during `stopServer()`, but it only clears the `stateCleanupInterval`.

Review Summary\\n\\n### 🔴 Critical\\n\\n1. **Documentation not updated** — AGENTS.md documents `getConfig()` and `setConfigValue(key, value)` but the signatures have changed to `getConfig(guildId?)` and `setConfigValue(path, value, guildId?)`. The \\\"Config Hot-Reload Behavior\\\" section and Config conventions also need updating. Per AGENTS.md's own rules: *\\\"Keep docs up to date — this is non-negotiable.\\\"*\\n\\n### 🟡 Warnings\\n\\n2. **`guildId` not threaded through ai.js call sites** — `getHistoryLength(guildId)` and `getHistoryTTLDays(guildId)` now accept `guildId` but 4 call sites in `ai.js` still call without it (`hydrateHistory`, `addToHistory`, `initConversationHistory`, `runCleanup`). Per-guild overrides of these values will be silently ignored.\\n\\n3. **Unbounded `configCache` Map** — No eviction or size cap on guild entries. Every `getConfig(guildId)` with overrides performs `structuredClone` + `deepMerge` on every call (hot path). Consider caching merged results or adding an LRU cap.\\n\\n4. **DB migration assumes `config_pkey` constraint name** — `ALTER TABLE config DROP CONSTRAINT config_pkey` will fail if the PK has a non-default name. Use `DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS` for robustness.\\n\\n5. **Asymmetric return semantics** — `getConfig()` returns a live mutable reference; `getConfig(guildId)` returns a detached clone.

Review Summary\\n\\n**🔴 Critical (1)**\\n\\n1. **Permission check uses stale global config** — `hasPermission()` at `src/index.js:188` passes the module-level `config` (global cache reference set once at startup) instead of `getConfig(interaction.guildId)`. Per-guild overrides for `permissions.adminRoleId`, `permissions.allowedCommands`, etc. are silently ignored for all permission decisions.\\n\\n**🟡 Warnings (3)**\\n\\n2. **`onConfigChange` listeners for logging transport don't filter by `guildId`** — The `logging.database.*` listeners in `src/index.js:358-373` will incorrectly recreate/destroy the singleton `pgTransport` when a guild writes a per-guild override to `logging.database.enabled`. They should guard with `if (guildId !== 'global') return;`.\\n\\n3. **`guildId` not threaded through `ai.js` internal call sites** — `getHistoryLength(guildId)` and `getHistoryTTLDays(guildId)` accept `guildId` but 4 internal callers (`hydrateHistory`, `addToHistory`, `initConversationHistory`, `runCleanup`) still call without it.\\n\\n4. **LRU eviction deletes guild overrides from `configCache`** — `cacheMergedResult()` at `src/modules/config.js:242-244` evicts from the raw override store, not just the merged cache. This silently drops persisted overrides from memory with no way to recover them until restart.\\n\\n**🟡 Documentation (1)**\\n\\n5. **AGENTS.md not updated** — Lines 79-80 still document `getConfig()` and `setConfigValue(key, value)`. The signatures are now `getConfig(guildId?)` and `setConfigValue(path, value, guildId?)`. The \\\"Config Hot-Reload Behavior\\\" section at lines 175-178 also references the old signatures. Per AGENTS.md's own rules: \\\"Keep docs up to date — this is non-negotiable.\\\"\\n\\n**🔵 Nitpicks (1)**\\n\\n6. **GET config test doesn't verify guild ID** — `tests/api/routes/guilds.test.js:144` asserts `getConfig` was called but doesn't verify it was called with `'guild1'`.\\n\\n### What looks correct\\n- SQL injection prevention via parameterized queries throughout ✓\\n- Prototype pollution protection via `DANGEROUS_KEYS` / `validatePathSegments` ✓\\n- Guild isolation via composite PK `(guild_id, key)` ✓\\n- Deep merge with `structuredClone` prevents shared references ✓\\n- All 13

Review Summary\\n\\n### 🔴 Critical (2)\\n\\n1. **Global config changes leave guild merged cache stale** (`src/modules/config.js:434`) — `mergedConfigCache.delete(guildId)` only removes the current guild's entry. When `guildId` is `'global'`, all other guild merged results remain stale. After `setConfigValue('ai.model', 'new-model')`, `getConfig('guild-123')` still returns the old value from the merged cache. The same issue exists in `resetConfig` for the global path. Fix: call `mergedConfigCache.clear()` when `guildId === 'global'`.\\n\\n2. **LRU eviction deletes authoritative guild overrides** (`src/modules/config.js:241-244`) — `cacheMergedResult()` evicts from `configCache` (the raw override store loaded from DB) when `mergedConfigCache` exceeds `MAX_GUILD_CACHE_SIZE`. After eviction, `getConfig(guildId)` silently returns only global defaults — the guild's DB-persisted overrides are lost until restart. Fix: only evict from `mergedConfigCache`, not `configCache`.\\n\\n### 🟡 Warning (2)\\n\\n3. **`hasPermission` uses stale module-level `config`** (`src/index.js:188`) — The central permission gate passes the module-level `config` (global cache reference set once at startup on line 57) to `hasPermission()` instead of `getConfig(interaction.guildId)`. Per-guild overrides for `permissions.adminRoleId`, `permissions.allowedCommands`, etc. are silently ignored. Every command handler calls `getConfig(interaction.guildId)`, but this pre-command gate bypasses that. [Fix this →](https://claude.ai/code?q=In%20src%2Findex.js%20at%20line%20188%2C%20replace%20%60config%60%20with%20%60getConfig(interaction.guildId)%60%20in%20the%20hasPermission%20call.%20Ensure%20getConfig%20is%20imported%20from%20src%2Fmodules%2Fconfig.js.%20Branch%3A%20feat%2Fper-guild-config\\u0026repo=BillChirico/bills-bot)\\n\\n4. **AGENTS.md not updated** — Lines 79-80 still document `getConfig()` and `setConfigValue(key, value)`. The signatures are now `getConfig(guildId?)` and `setConfigValue(path, value, guildId?)`. The \\\"Config Hot-Reload Behavior\\\" section (line 175) also references the old `getConfig()` signature. Per AGENTS.md's own rules: *\\\"Keep docs up to date — this is non-negotiable.\\\"* [Fix this →](https://claude.ai/code?q=Update%20AGENTS.md%20lines%2079-80%20to%20document%20getConfig(guildId%3F)%20and%20setConfigValue(path%2C%20value%2C%20guildId%3F).%20Also%20update%20line%20175%20to%20mention%20getConfig(guildId).%20Branch%3A%20feat%2Fper-guild-config\\u0026repo=BillChirico/bills-bot)\\n\\n### 🔵 Nitpick (2)\\n\\n5. **Reset message misleading for guild-scoped resets** (`src/commands/config.js:341-342`) — The embed says \\\"reset to defaults from config.json\\\" for all resets, but for guild resets, the operation deletes guild overrides so global defaults apply — which may differ from `config.json` if global config has been modified. Consider wording like \\\"reset to global defaults\\\" for guild resets.\\n\\n6. **GET config test doesn't verify `getConfig` receives the guild ID** (`tests/api/routes/guilds.test.js:144`) — The

Review Summary\\n\\n### 🔴 Critical\\n\\n1. **Documentation not updated** — AGENTS.md documents `getConfig()` and `setConfigValue(key, value)` but the signatures have changed to `getConfig(guildId?)` and `setConfigValue(path, value, guildId?)`. The \\\"Config Hot-Reload Behavior\\\" section and Config conventions also need updating. Per AGENTS.md's own rules: *\\\"Keep docs up to date — this is non-negotiable.\\\"*\\n\\n### 🟡 Warnings\\n\\n2. **`guildId` not threaded through ai.js call sites** — `getHistoryLength(guildId)` and `getHistoryTTLDays(guildId)` now accept `guildId` but 4 call sites in `ai.js` still call without it (`hydrateHistory`, `addToHistory`, `initConversationHistory`, `runCleanup`). Per-guild overrides of these values will be silently ignored.\\n\\n3. **Unbounded `configCache` Map** — No eviction or size cap on guild entries. Every `getConfig(guildId)` with overrides performs `structuredClone` + `deepMerge` on every call (hot path). Consider caching merged results or adding an LRU cap.\\n\\n4. **DB migration assumes `config_pkey` constraint name** — `ALTER TABLE config DROP CONSTRAINT config_pkey` will fail if the PK has a non-default name. Use `DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS` for robustness.\\n\\n5. **Asymmetric return semantics** — `getConfig()` returns a live mutable reference; `getConfig(guildId)` returns a detached clone. This is intentional for backward compat but should be called out more clearly in comments.\\n\\n### 🔵 Nitpicks\\n\\n6. **Eager loading of all guild configs** — `loadConfig()` fetches all rows for all guilds at startup. Acceptable now but a scaling concern.\\n\\n### What looks correct\\n- SQL injection prevention: all queries use parameterized `$1/$2/$3` placeholders ✓\\n- Prototype pollution protection via `validatePathSegments` / `DANGEROUS_KEYS` ✓  \\n- Guild isolation via composite PK `(guild_id, key)` ✓\\n- Deep merge with `structuredClone` prevents shared references ✓\\n- All 13 command files correctly pass `interaction.guildId` ✓\\n- REST API validates guild exists via `validateGuild` middleware before config operations ✓\\n- Test coverage for guild isolation, deep merge, fallback, reset, and multi-guild ✓\\n- Config change events correctly pass `guildId` as 4th argument ✓\",\"commit_id\":\"c355e53695c62e9315a0a629bf3212a67ff05f0c\",\"html_url\":\"https://github.com/BillChirico/bills-bot/pull/74#pullrequestreview-3815016209\",\"id\":3815016209,\"node_id\":\"PRR_kwDORICdSM7jZIcR\",\"pull_request_url\":\"https://api.github.com/repos/BillChirico/bills-bot/pulls/74\",\"state\":\"CHANGES_REQUESTED\",\"submitted_at\":\"2026-02-17T16:34:22Z\",\"user\":{\"avatar_url\":\"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1236702?v=4\",\"events_url\":\"https://api.github.com/users/claude%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}\",\"followers_url\":\"https://api.github.com/users/claude%5Bbot%5D/followers\",\"following_url\":\"https://api.github.com/users/claude%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}\",\"gists_url\":\"https://api.github.com/users/claude%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}\",\"gravatar_id\":\"\",\"html_url\":\"https://github.com/apps/claude\",\"id\":209825114,\"login\":\"claude[bot]\",\"node_id\":\"BOT_kgDODIGtWg\",\"organizations_url\":\"https://api.github.com/users/claude%5Bbot%5D/orgs\",\"received_events_url\":\"https://api.github.com/users/claude%5Bbot%5D/received_events\",\"repos_url\":\"https://api.github.com/users/claude%5Bbot%5D/repos\",\"site_admin\":false,\"starred_url\":\"https://api.github.com/users/claude%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}\",\"subscriptions_url\":\"https://api.github.com/users/claude%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions\",\"type\":\"Bot\",\"url\":\"https://api.github.com/users/claude%5Bbot%5D\",\"user_view_type\":\"public\"}},{\"_links\":{\"html\":{\"href\":\"https://github.com/BillChirico/bills-bot/pull/74#pullrequestreview-3815016782\"},\"pull_request\":{\"href\":\"https://api.github.com/repos/BillChirico/bills-bot/pulls/74\"}},\"author_association\":\"CONTRIBUTOR\",\"body\":\"**Actionable comments posted: 6**\\n\\n\\u003e [!CAUTION]\\n\\u003e Some comments are outside the diff and can’t be posted inline due to platform limitations.\\n\\u003e \\n\\u003e \\n\\u003e \\n\\u003e \\u003cdetails\\u003e\\n\\u003e \\u003csummary\\u003e⚠️ Outside diff range comments (7)\\u003c/summary\\u003e\\u003cblockquote\\u003e\\n\\u003e \\n\\u003e \\u003cdetails\\u003e\\n\\u003e \\u003csummary\\u003esrc/modules/ai.js (2)\\u003c/summary\\u003e\\u003cblockquote\\u003e\\n\\u003e \\n\\u003e `214-226`: _⚠️ Potential issue_ | _🟡 Minor_\\n\\u003e \\n\\u003e **`addToHistory` has `guildId` but doesn't pass it to `getHistoryLength()`.**\\n\\u003e \\n\\u003e Line 221 calls `getHistoryLength()` without arguments, even though `guildId` is available as a parameter on Line 214.

Review Summary\\n\\n**🔴 Critical (1)**\\n\\n1. **Permission check uses stale global config** — `hasPermission()` at `src/index.js:188` passes the module-level `config` (global cache reference set once at startup) instead of `getConfig(interaction.guildId)`. Per-guild overrides for `permissions.adminRoleId`, `permissions.allowedCommands`, etc. are silently ignored for all permission decisions.\\n\\n**🟡 Warnings (3)**\\n\\n2. **`onConfigChange` listeners for logging transport don't filter by `guildId`** — The `logging.database.*` listeners in `src/index.js:358-373` will incorrectly recreate/destroy the singleton `pgTransport` when a guild writes a per-guild override to `logging.database.enabled`. They should guard with `if (guildId !== 'global') return;`.\\n\\n3. **`guildId` not threaded through `ai.js` internal call sites** — `getHistoryLength(guildId)` and `getHistoryTTLDays(guildId)` accept `guildId` but 4 internal callers (`hydrateHistory`, `addToHistory`, `initConversationHistory`, `runCleanup`) still call without it.\\n\\n4. **LRU eviction deletes guild overrides from `configCache`** — `cacheMergedResult()` at `src/modules/config.js:242-244` evicts from the raw override store, not just the merged cache. This silently drops persisted overrides from memory with no way to recover them until restart.\\n\\n**🟡 Documentation (1)**\\n\\n5. **AGENTS.md not updated** — Lines 79-80 still document `getConfig()` and `setConfigValue(key, value)`. The signatures are now `getConfig(guildId?)` and `setConfigValue(path, value, guildId?)`. The \\\"Config Hot-Reload Behavior\\\" section at lines 175-178 also references the old signatures. Per AGENTS.md's own rules: \\\"Keep docs up to date — this is non-negotiable.\\\"\\n\\n**🔵 Nitpicks (1)**\\n\\n6. **GET config test doesn't verify guild ID** — `tests/api/routes/guilds.test.js:144` asserts `getConfig` was called but doesn't verify it was called with `'guild1'`.\\n\\n### What looks correct\\n- SQL injection prevention via parameterized queries throughout ✓\\n- Prototype pollution protection via `DANGEROUS_KEYS` / `validatePathSegments` ✓\\n- Guild isolation via composite PK `(guild_id, key)` ✓\\n- Deep merge with `structuredClone` prevents shared references ✓\\n- All 13 command files correctly pass `interaction.guildId` ✓\\n- REST API validates guild via `validateGuild` middleware ✓\\n- Merged config cache with LRU cap (`MAX_GUILD_CACHE_SIZE = 500`) ✓\\n- Test

Review Summary\\n\\n### 🔴 Critical (2)\\n\\n1. **Global config changes leave guild merged cache stale** (`src/modules/config.js:434`) — `mergedConfigCache.delete(guildId)` only removes the current guild's entry. When `guildId` is `'global'`, all other guild merged results remain stale. After `setConfigValue('ai.model', 'new-model')`, `getConfig('guild-123')` still returns the old value from the merged cache. The same issue exists in `resetConfig` for the global path. Fix: call `mergedConfigCache.clear()` when `guildId === 'global'`.\\n\\n2. **LRU eviction deletes authoritative guild overrides** (`src/modules/config.js:241-244`) — `cacheMergedResult()` evicts from `configCache` (the raw override store loaded from DB) when `mergedConfigCache` exceeds `MAX_GUILD_CACHE_SIZE`. After eviction, `getConfig(guildId)` silently returns only global defaults — the guild's DB-persisted overrides are lost until restart. Fix: only evict from `mergedConfigCache`, not `configCache`.\\n\\n### 🟡 Warning (2)\\n\\n3. **`hasPermission` uses stale module-level `config`** (`src/index.js:188`) — The central permission gate passes the module-level `config` (global cache reference set once at startup on line 57) to `hasPermission()` instead of `getConfig(interaction.guildId)`. Per-guild overrides for `permissions.adminRoleId`, `permissions.allowedCommands`, etc. are silently ignored. Every command handler calls `getConfig(interaction.guildId)`, but this pre-command gate bypasses that. [Fix this →](https://claude.ai/code?q=In%20src%2Findex.js%20at%20line%20188%2C%20replace%20%60config%60%20with%20%60getConfig(interaction.guildId)%60%20in%20the%20hasPermission%20call.%20Ensure%20getConfig%20is%20imported%20from%20src%2Fmodules%2Fconfig.js.%20Branch%3A%20feat%2Fper-guild-config\\u0026repo=BillChirico/bills-bot)\\n\\n4. **AGENTS.md not updated** — Lines 79-80 still document `getConfig()` and `setConfigValue(key, value)`. The signatures are now `getConfig(guildId?)` and `setConfigValue(path, value, guildId?)`. The \\\"Config Hot-Reload Behavior\\\" section (line 175) also references the old `getConfig()` signature. Per AGENTS.md's own rules: *\\\"Keep docs up to date — this is non-negotiable.\\\"* [Fix this →](https://claude.ai/code?q=Update%20AGENTS.md%20lines%2079-80%20to%20document%20getConfig(guildId%3F)%20and%20setConfigValue(path%2C%20value%2C%20guildId%3F).%20Also%20update%20line%20175%20to%20mention%20getConfig(guildId).%20Branch%3A%20feat%2Fper-guild-config\\u0026repo=BillChirico/bills-bot)\\n\\n### 🔵 Nitpick (2)\\n\\n5. **Reset message misleading for guild-scoped resets** (`src/commands/config.js:341-342`) — The embed says \\\"reset to defaults from config.json\\\" for all resets, but for guild resets, the operation deletes guild overrides so global defaults apply — which may differ from `config.json` if global config has been modified. Consider wording like \\\"reset to global defaults\\\" for guild resets.\\n\\n6. **GET config test doesn't verify `getConfig` receives the guild ID** (`tests/api/routes/guilds.test.js:144`) — The

Update the code in requireAuth to remove\\nthe separate if (!apiSecret \\u0026\\u0026 !authHeader) block and the subsequent identical\\nwarn/return, replacing both with one warn('Unauthorized API request', { ip:\\nreq.ip, path: req.path }) followed by return res.status(401).json({ error:\\n'Unauthorized' }) so that both \\\"no credentials\\\" and \\\"bad credentials\\\" fall\\nthrough to the same single handler.\\n\\nIn `@src/api/middleware/oauth.js`:\\n- Around line 14-36: Extract the duplicated JWT extraction and verification from\\nthe GET /me handler and reuse the existing requireOAuth middleware: remove the\\nBearer token parsing, SESSION_SECRET check, and jwt.verify logic in the /me\\nroute handler and instead apply requireOAuth(req,res,next) to that route so the\\nroute reads the authenticated user from req.user;

update the OAuth middleware that checks\\nsessionSecret (variable sessionSecret) to log a contextual error via the Winston\\nlogger before sending the response—e.g., use the module's logger instance\\n(import or require the project's Winston logger) to log an error like \\\"Session\\nsecret not configured (SESSION_SECRET missing)\\\" including any request context\\n(route/method) and then return res.status(500).json({ error: 'Session not\\nconfigured' }); so the error is recorded per src/ coding guidelines.\\n- Around line 29-35: The jwt.verify call in the middleware (where token and\\nsessionSecret are used and req.user is set before calling next) does not specify\\nallowed algorithms, leaving it open to algorithm confusion attacks; update the\\nverify invocation to pass an explicit algorithms array matching your\\nissuer/signing method (e.g., the HS or RS algorithm you actually use) so only\\nthat algorithm is accepted, and ensure the token validation still throws so the\\nexisting catch returns the 401 via res.status when verification fails.\\n\\nIn `@src/api/routes/auth.js`:\\n- Around line 101-116: The JWT currently embeds the full guild list which causes\\nstaleness and large payloads; update the token creation in auth.js (the jwt.sign\\ncall that assigns token, using sessionSecret and expiresIn '7d') to include only\\nminimal, stable claims (e.g., userId and maybe username) and remove the guilds\\narray from the payload, and then implement one of two options: (A) change\\nexpiresIn to a short lifetime (e.g., '1h') and add a refresh token flow to mint\\nnew JWTs, or (B) keep longer JWTs but always fetch/cached guild membership and\\npermissions at request time (or via a short-TTL cache) instead of reading them\\nfrom the token; ensure any authorization checks read guilds from that runtime\\nsource rather than from the JWT.\\n- Around line 120-122: Replace the current query-parameter redirect that exposes\\nthe JWT (res.redirect(`${dashboardUrl}?token=${token}`)) with a safer delivery:\\nset the JWT in an HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Strict cookie (use\\nres.cookie('token', token, { httpOnly: true, secure: true, sameSite: 'Strict',\\nmaxAge: ... })) and then call res.redirect(dashboardUrl) so the token is not in\\nthe URL; alternatively implement a short-lived single-use authorization code\\nflow (issue code server-side, redirect with code, then exchange via POST) or, if\\na quicker mitigation is needed, switch to a fragment-based redirect\\n(res.redirect(`${dashboardUrl}#token=${token}`)) while noting fragments are\\nclient-only.\\n- Around line 55-97: The three Discord API fetches in auth.js (the token\\nexchange fetch that yields tokenResponse/tokenData/accessToken, the user info\\nfetch that yields userResponse/user, and the guilds fetch that yields\\nguildsResponse) lack timeouts and can hang; update each fetch call to use an\\nAbortController or AbortSignal.timeout with a sensible timeout (e.g., 10s), pass\\nthe resulting signal in the fetch options, and ensure you abort/cleanup the\\ncontroller on completion or error so requests are reliably cancelled if Discord\\nis slow.\\n\\nIn `@src/api/routes/guilds.js`:\\n- Around line 54-67: isOAuthGuildAdmin currently trusts JWT-embedded guild\\npermissions (using ADMINISTRATOR_FLAG) which can be stale for up to 7 days;\\nupdate the auth flow and permission checks by either (A) reducing the JWT\\nexpiresIn in auth.js to shorten the window of stale claims, or (B) changing\\nsensitive write endpoints to revalidate admin status on-demand via the Discord\\nAPI instead of relying on isOAuthGuildAdmin, or (C) implement a token\\nrevocation/blacklist that invalidates JWTs when a user's guild roles change;\\nlocate uses of isOAuthGuildAdmin in src/api/routes/guilds.js and replace or\\naugment them with an async Discord permission check (or gate them behind a\\nhelper that consults the revocation list), and update the JWT creation in\\nauth.js where expiresIn is set to apply option (A) if chosen.\\n\\nIn `@src/commands/modlog.js`:\\n- Around line 35-41: The permission error message for /modlog is misleading:\\nupdate the permission helper so it can produce a moderator-specific message and\\nuse it from the modlog check. Either add a new function\\ngetModeratorPermissionError() in the permissions utility (or extend\\ngetPermissionError(requiredLevel)) to return a message referencing\\nmoderator/ManageGuild access, then replace the call to\\ngetPermissionError('modlog') in src/commands/modlog.js with the new\\ngetModeratorPermissionError() (or\\ngetPermissionError('moderator'/'ManageGuild')), keeping the existing\\nisModerator(interaction.member, config) check unchanged.\\n\\nIn `@src/utils/permissions.js`:\\n- Around line 95-112: The two functions isGuildAdmin and isAdmin duplicate\\nlogic; consolidate by making one the single source of truth—e.g., relax the\\nstrict config null-check in isAdmin so it safely handles optional config and\\nthen have isGuildAdmin simply call and return isAdmin(member, config). Ensure\\nisAdmin still performs isBotOwner(member), checks\\nmember.permissions.has(PermissionFlagsBits.Administrator), and if\\nconfig?.permissions?.adminRoleId is present uses\\nmember.roles.cache.has(config.permissions.adminRoleId); remove the duplicated\\nlogic from isGuildAdmin so all checks live in isAdmin.\\n- Around line 9-10: BOT_OWNER_ID is hardcoded; switch to reading the owners list\\nfrom config.permissions.botOwners and remove the constant. Update the module to\\nexport a helper that accepts the config (or export a function isBotOwner(config,\\nuserId)) and use config.permissions.botOwners (supporting multiple IDs) inside\\nisBotOwner instead of BOT_OWNER_ID; then update all callers of isBotOwner to\\npass the app config through.

Review Summary\\n\\nThe fix commit (38feff0) addressed many of the earlier review findings well — CSRF state parameter, algorithm pinning, fragment-based token redirect, fresh guild fetching, `isGuildAdmin` consolidation, and `getPermissionError` level parameter are all solid improvements.\\n\\n**Remaining issues:**\\n\\n**🔴 Critical (1)**\\n- **Discord access token stored in plaintext JWT** (`src/api/routes/auth.js:126-136`): The Discord OAuth2 access token is embedded directly in the JWT payload. JWTs are signed but not encrypted — anyone who obtains the token can base64-decode it and extract the raw Discord access token. Store the access token server-side instead.\\n\\n**🟡 Warning (3)**\\n- **Missing `requireGuildAdmin` on stats/members/moderation routes** (`src/api/routes/guilds.js`): Config and actions endpoints correctly have the middleware, but `/:id/stats`, `/:id/members`, and `/:id/moderation` do not. Any OAuth user can access sensitive data for any guild.\\n- **`oauthStates` map grows unboundedly** (`src/api/routes/auth.js:16-28`): Cleanup only runs on new OAuth redirects. Add interval-based cleanup or bound the map size.\\n- **`fetchUserGuilds` called on every admin-gated request** (`src/api/routes/guilds.js:79-89`): Each request to a protected endpoint triggers a Discord API round-trip.

The guard/bypass ordering mirrors `isAdmin`, which is consistent.\\n\\n---\\n\\n`132-141`: **`getPermissionError` update is clean.**\\n\\nThe `level` parameter with a sensible default provides flexible, user-facing error messages without breaking existing callers.\\n\\n\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\u003c/details\\u003e\\n\\u003cdetails\\u003e\\n\\u003csummary\\u003etests/api/routes/guilds.test.js (3)\\u003c/summary\\u003e\\u003cblockquote\\u003e\\n\\n`93-99`: **Good test isolation with cleanup of shared state.**\\n\\nClearing `sessionStore`, `guildCache`, mocks, env stubs, and restoring spies ensures no leakage between tests.\\n\\n---\\n\\n`136-146`: **JWT Bearer authentication test is well-constructed.**\\n\\nThe SESSION_SECRET env stub matches the signing secret used in `createOAuthToken`, and the test correctly validates that the Bearer token is accepted as an alternative to the `x-api-secret` header.\\n\\n---\\n\\n`158-195`: **GET `/` tests cover the key authorization matrix well.**\\n\\nThe three tests verify: (1) API-secret gets unfiltered results, (2) OAuth gets only admin+bot-present guilds, and (3) OAuth with no admin perms gets empty results. The use of `permissions: '8'` (ADMINISTRATOR bitmask) vs `'0'` is correct for Discord's permission model.\\n\\n\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\u003c/details\\u003e\\n\\u003cdetails\\u003e\\n\\u003csummary\\u003etests/api/routes/auth.test.js (3)\\u003c/summary\\u003e\\u003cblockquote\\u003e\\n\\n`1-34`: **Test setup is clean and minimal.**\\n\\nLogger mock, lightweight client stub, and proper cleanup in `afterEach` are all correct.

Update\\nthe block that currently does \\\"if (!sessionSecret) { return res.status(401)...\\n}\\\" to log a clear error including the missing SESSION_SECRET (use the existing\\nlogger variable in this module, or console.error if none) and respond with\\nres.status(500). Keep the response body similar (e.g., { error: 'Session not\\nconfigured' }) but ensure an error log is emitted before sending the 500.\\n\\nIn `@src/api/middleware/oauth.js`:\\n- Around line 26-28: The error log for the missing SESSION_SECRET (the call to\\nerror(...) when sessionSecret is falsy in oauth middleware) should include\\nstructured Winston metadata: update the error(...) invocation to pass an object\\nwith request context like { method: req.method, url: req.originalUrl || req.url,\\nip: req.ip, headers: req.headers \\u0026\\u0026 { host: req.headers.host },\\nsessionConfigured: false } so the log includes request-scoped details and a flag\\nindicating session config; keep the existing message string but add this\\nmetadata object as the second argument before returning the\\nres.status(500).json(...) response.\\n\\nIn `@src/api/routes/auth.js`:\\n- Around line 16-17: sessionStore currently holds raw entries and grows without\\neviction; implement TTL-based entries and periodic cleanup similar to\\noauthStates. Change sessionStore to map userId → { accessToken, createdAt } (or\\nexpiresAt) and update code that writes to it (login flow) to store the\\ntimestamp; update the logout handler to remove the userId from sessionStore; add\\na cleanup job (setInterval) that iterates sessionStore and deletes entries older\\nthan the chosen TTL (e.g., 1 hour, matching JWT expiry); ensure any code that\\nreads sessionStore (token refresh or auth checks) respects the expiry and\\nremoves stale entries.\\n- Around line 147-157: The jwt.sign call that creates `token` omits the explicit\\nsigning algorithm; update the `jwt.sign` invocation (the token creation block\\nusing `jwt.sign` and `sessionSecret`) to include the option `{ algorithm:\\n'HS256' }` alongside `expiresIn: '1h'` so it explicitly matches the verification\\ncode that uses `algorithms: ['HS256']`.\\n- Around line 200-205: The logout route currently just returns a JSON message\\nbut doesn't revoke the server-side session stored in sessionStore; update the\\nrouter.post('/logout', ...) handler to remove the user's session/Discord access\\ntoken from sessionStore (use whichever key you use elsewhere — e.g.,\\nreq.user.id, req.sessionID, or the JWT subject) before returning the response,\\nhandle the sessionStore removal as an async operation or check its return value\\nand log or return an error if deletion fails, and ensure the route still\\nresponds with the success message only after the session has been cleared.\\n\\nIn `@src/api/routes/guilds.js`:\\n- Around line 74-83: fetchUserGuilds currently returns an empty array on any\\nnon-OK Discord response which causes isOAuthGuildAdmin/requireGuildAdmin to\\ntreat API failures as “no guilds” and return a misleading 403; change\\nfetchUserGuilds to throw an error (including response status/text) when\\nresponse.ok is false so callers can distinguish failure from an empty list, and\\nupdate requireGuildAdmin (or its caller) to catch that specific fetch error and\\ntranslate it into a 502 response (with an appropriate message) instead of a 403;\\nreference the functions fetchUserGuilds and requireGuildAdmin/isOAuthGuildAdmin\\nwhen making these changes.\\n\\nIn `@src/utils/permissions.js`:\\n- Around line 61-66: The early return guard in hasPermission currently returns\\nfalse when config is null before checking isBotOwner, making bot-owner bypass\\nunreachable; update hasPermission so the bot-owner check (call to isBotOwner)\\nruns before or regardless of the config null/undefined guard (e.g., validate\\nmember and commandName first, then if isBotOwner(member, config) return true,\\nand only afterwards return false if config is missing or perform other\\npermission checks) to mirror the isAdmin pattern.\\n\\nIn `@tests/api/routes/auth.test.js`:\\n- Around line 173-180: Test currently only asserts a 200 and message for the\\n'POST /api/v1/auth/logout' endpoint; update the test to (1) create a logged-in\\nsession (add a session entry to sessionStore or obtain a valid token via the\\nlogin helper), call the logout route with that token, then assert the\\nsessionStore no longer contains that session (or token is invalidated), and (2)\\nassert the endpoint enforces auth by calling it without a token and expecting a\\n401/unauthorized response; reference the POST /api/v1/auth/logout test, the\\nsessionStore object, and the auth middleware/token helper to locate where to add\\nthese assertions.\\n- Around line 87-171: Add a test case to verify the /api/v1/auth/me route\\nrejects revoked/missing server-side sessions: in auth.test.js create a test\\n(e.g., \\\"should return 401 when session is revoked/missing\\\") that stubs\\nSESSION_SECRET, signs a JWT for userId '123' with

`@tests/api/routes/guilds.test.js`:\\n- Around line 101-120: The fetch mock in mockFetchGuilds is using\\nvi.spyOn(...).mockResolvedValue (persistent) which can hide extra fetch calls;\\nchange mockResolvedValue to mockResolvedValueOnce in the mockFetchGuilds helper\\nso each test gets a single-use response (or explicitly chain multiple\\nmockResolvedValueOnce calls when a test expects

is failing due to 3 Biome formatting violations in test files. These must be fixed before merge.\\n\\n**🔴 CI Failures (3)**\\n1. `tests/api/routes/auth.test.js:198-201` — multi-line `jwt.sign` call should be collapsed to single line\\n2. `tests/api/routes/guilds.test.js:151-154` — same formatting issue\\n3. `tests/commands/config.test.js:188-190, 217-219` — incorrect indentation inside `mockImplementationOnce` arrow function body\\n\\n**🟡 Warning (1)**\\n4. `src/api/routes/auth.js:89-91` — `stopAuthCleanup()` only clears the `stateCleanupInterval` but not `sessionCleanupInterval`. `stopSessionCleanup()` is exported (line 97) but never imported or called during server shutdown, so the session cleanup interval leaks on shutdown.\\n\\n**🔵 Nitpick (2)**\\n5. `src/api/routes/auth.js:93-99` — `stopSessionCleanup` is dead code (exported but never imported). Fold its logic into `stopAuthCleanup` and remove the unused export.\\n6. `src/api/routes/guilds.js:58` — `guildCache` never proactively evicts expired entries; stale entries accumulate for users who don't make repeat requests.\",\"commit_id\":\"2ea7ea4e5d4c9c9ae1cd998574a2c581ae5b33ae\",\"html_url\":\"https://github.com/BillChirico/bills-bot/pull/73#pullrequestreview-3815248844\",\"id\":3815248844,\"node_id\":\"PRR_kwDORICdSM7jaBPM\",\"pull_request_url\":\"https://api.github.com/repos/BillChirico/bills-bot/pulls/73\",\"state\":\"CHANGES_REQUESTED\",\"submitted_at\":\"2026-02-17T17:21:11Z\",\"user\":{\"avatar_url\":\"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1236702?v=4\",\"events_url\":\"https://api.github.com/users/claude%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}\",\"followers_url\":\"https://api.github.com/users/claude%5Bbot%5D/followers\",\"following_url\":\"https://api.github.com/users/claude%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}\",\"gists_url\":\"https://api.github.com/users/claude%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}\",\"gravatar_id\":\"\",\"html_url\":\"https://github.com/apps/claude\",\"id\":209825114,\"login\":\"claude[bot]\",\"node_id\":\"BOT_kgDODIGtWg\",\"organizations_url\":\"https://api.github.com/users/claude%5Bbot%5D/orgs\",\"received_events_url\":\"https://api.github.com/users/claude%5Bbot%5D/received_events\",\"repos_url\":\"https://api.github.com/users/claude%5Bbot%5D/repos\",\"site_admin\":false,\"starred_url\":\"https://api.github.com/users/claude%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}\",\"subscriptions_url\":\"https://api.github.com/users/claude%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions\",\"type\":\"Bot\",\"url\":\"https://api.github.com/users/claude%5Bbot%5D\",\"user_view_type\":\"public\"}},{\"_links\":{\"html\":{\"href\":\"https://github.com/BillChirico/bills-bot/pull/73#pullrequestreview-3815265091\"},\"pull_request\":{\"href\":\"https://api.github.com/repos/BillChirico/bills-bot/pulls/73\"}},\"author_association\":\"NONE\",\"body\":\"LGTM — all critical and major issues from prior reviews have been addressed.

update the\\nverify invocation to pass an explicit algorithms array matching your\\nissuer/signing method (e.g., the HS or RS algorithm you actually use) so only\\nthat algorithm is accepted, and ensure the token validation still throws so the\\nexisting catch returns the 401 via res.status when verification fails.\\n\\nIn `@src/api/routes/auth.js`:\\n- Around line 101-116: The JWT currently embeds the full guild list which causes\\nstaleness and large payloads; update the token creation in auth.js (the jwt.sign\\ncall that assigns token, using sessionSecret and expiresIn '7d') to include only\\nminimal, stable claims (e.g., userId and maybe username) and remove the guilds\\narray from the payload, and then implement one of two options: (A) change\\nexpiresIn to a short lifetime (e.g., '1h') and add a refresh token flow to mint\\nnew JWTs, or (B) keep longer JWTs but always fetch/cached guild membership and\\npermissions at request time (or via a short-TTL cache) instead of reading them\\nfrom the token; ensure any authorization checks read guilds from that runtime\\nsource rather than from the JWT.\\n- Around line 120-122: Replace the current query-parameter redirect that exposes\\nthe JWT (res.redirect(`${dashboardUrl}?token=${token}`)) with a safer delivery:\\nset the JWT in an HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Strict cookie (use\\nres.cookie('token', token, { httpOnly: true, secure: true, sameSite: 'Strict',\\nmaxAge: ... })) and then call res.redirect(dashboardUrl) so the token is not in\\nthe URL; alternatively implement a short-lived single-use authorization code\\nflow (issue code server-side, redirect with code, then exchange via POST) or, if\\na quicker mitigation is needed, switch to a fragment-based redirect\\n(res.redirect(`${dashboardUrl}#token=${token}`)) while noting fragments are\\nclient-only.\\n- Around line 55-97: The three Discord API fetches in auth.js (the token\\nexchange fetch that yields tokenResponse/tokenData/accessToken, the user info\\nfetch that yields userResponse/user, and the guilds fetch that yields\\nguildsResponse) lack timeouts and can hang; update each fetch call to use an\\nAbortController or AbortSignal.timeout with a sensible timeout (e.g., 10s), pass\\nthe resulting signal in the fetch options, and ensure you abort/cleanup the\\ncontroller on completion or error so requests are reliably cancelled if Discord\\nis slow.\\n\\nIn `@src/api/routes/guilds.js`:\\n- Around line 54-67: isOAuthGuildAdmin currently trusts JWT-embedded guild\\npermissions (using ADMINISTRATOR_FLAG) which can be stale for up to 7 days;\\nupdate the auth flow and permission checks by either (A) reducing the JWT\\nexpiresIn in auth.js to shorten the window of stale claims, or (B) changing\\nsensitive write endpoints to revalidate admin status on-demand via the Discord\\nAPI instead of relying on isOAuthGuildAdmin, or (C) implement a token\\nrevocation/blacklist that invalidates JWTs when a user's guild roles change;\\nlocate uses of isOAuthGuildAdmin in src/api/routes/guilds.js and replace or\\naugment them with an async Discord permission check (or gate them behind a\\nhelper that consults the revocation list), and update the JWT creation in\\nauth.js where expiresIn is set to apply option (A) if chosen.\\n\\nIn `@src/commands/modlog.js`:\\n- Around line 35-41: The permission error message for /modlog is misleading:\\nupdate the permission helper so it can produce a moderator-specific message and\\nuse it from the modlog check. Either add a new function\\ngetModeratorPermissionError() in the permissions utility (or extend\\ngetPermissionError(requiredLevel)) to return a message referencing\\nmoderator/ManageGuild access, then replace the call to\\ngetPermissionError('modlog') in src/commands/modlog.js with the new\\ngetModeratorPermissionError() (or\\ngetPermissionError('moderator'/'ManageGuild')), keeping the existing\\nisModerator(interaction.member, config) check unchanged.\\n\\nIn `@src/utils/permissions.js`:\\n- Around line 95-112: The two functions isGuildAdmin and isAdmin duplicate\\nlogic; consolidate by making one the single source of truth—e.g., relax the\\nstrict config null-check in isAdmin so it safely handles optional config and\\nthen have isGuildAdmin simply call and return isAdmin(member, config). Ensure\\nisAdmin still performs isBotOwner(member), checks\\nmember.permissions.has(PermissionFlagsBits.Administrator), and if\\nconfig?.permissions?.adminRoleId is present uses\\nmember.roles.cache.has(config.permissions.adminRoleId); remove the duplicated\\nlogic from isGuildAdmin so all checks live in isAdmin.\\n- Around line 9-10: BOT_OWNER_ID is hardcoded; switch to reading the owners list\\nfrom config.permissions.botOwners and remove the constant. Update the module to\\nexport a helper that accepts the config (or export a function isBotOwner(config,\\nuserId)) and use config.permissions.botOwners (supporting multiple IDs) inside\\nisBotOwner instead of BOT_OWNER_ID; then update all callers of isBotOwner to\\npass the app config through. Ensure the exported symbol BOT_OWNER_ID is\\nremoved/deprecated and references are replaced with the new config-driven\\nisBotOwner usage.\\n\\nIn `@tests/commands/config.test.js`:\\n- Around line 15-18: Add a new test that simulates permission denial by mocking\\nisGuildAdmin to return false and asserting the command returns the ephemeral\\npermission error from getPermissionError; specifically, in\\ntests/commands/config.test.js override vi.mock for isGuildAdmin to\\nvi.fn().mockReturnValue(false), call the code path that executes the /config\\ncommand (the same test helper used elsewhere in this file), and assert the reply\\nis ephemeral and equals getPermissionError() so the permission guard for the\\nconfig command is exercised end-to-end.\\n\\nIn `@tests/commands/modlog.test.js`:\\n- Around line 32-35: Add a test covering the permission-denial path by mocking\\nisModerator to return false, invoking the modlog command's execute function with\\na created interaction, and asserting the interaction.reply was called with an\\nephemeral error containing the permission message; specifically, in the test\\nfile use isModerator.mockReturnValueOnce(false), call createInteraction('view')\\n(or same helper used elsewhere) then await execute(interaction) and\\nexpect(interaction.reply).toHaveBeenCalledWith(expect.objectContaining({\\ncontent: expect.stringContaining(\\\"don't have permission\\\"), ephemeral: true }));\\nreference isModerator, execute and createInteraction to locate where to add this\\ncase.\\n\\nIn `@tests/utils/permissions.test.js`:\\n- Around line 244-284: Add a test that passes a null config into isModerator to\\ncover the nullable-config code path: create a member (e.g., with permissions.has\\nmocked to false and roles.cache.has mocked to false) and assert\\nisModerator(member, null) returns false (and add a separate case if needed where\\nmember is bot owner or has ManageGuild permission to assert true when config is\\nnull). Reference the isModerator function and the existing test patterns\\n(permissions.has and roles.cache.has mocks) to add the new null-config\\nassertions so the implementation's null-config handling is exercised.\\n- Around line 207-242: Add a test that verifies isGuildAdmin handles a null\\nconfig without throwing: create a non-admin member stub (permissions.has -\\u003e\\nfalse, roles.cache.has -\\u003e false) and call isGuildAdmin(member, null) asserting\\nit returns false; place this new case inside the existing\\ndescribe('isGuildAdmin') block so it covers the optional chaining path in\\nisGuildAdmin.\\n\\n---\\n\\nOutside diff comments:\\nIn `@src/api/routes/guilds.js`:\\n- Around line 243-276: Add the requireGuildAdmin middleware to the guild\\nadmin-only routes: include requireGuildAdmin in the route handler chain for\\nrouter.get('/:id/stats'), router.get('/:id/members') and\\nrouter.get('/:id/moderation') so the middleware runs before the async handler;\\nif requireGuildAdmin is not already imported in this file, import it and apply\\nit as the second parameter (e.g., router.get('/:id/stats', requireGuildAdmin,\\nasync (req, res) =\\u003e { ... })), ensuring the same change is made for the members\\nand moderation route handlers to restrict access to guild admins only.\\n\\n---\\n\\nDuplicate comments:\\nIn `@src/api/routes/auth.js`:\\n- Around line 146-147: The jwt.verify call in the authentication flow\\n(jwt.verify(token, sessionSecret)) must include an explicit algorithms option to\\nprevent algorithm confusion; update the verify call used in the auth route to\\npass a third parameter like { algorithms: ['HS256'] } (or the exact algorithm\\nyour tokens use) so jwt.verify(token, sessionSecret, { algorithms: [...] })\\nexplicitly

Review Summary\\n\\nThe fix commit (38feff0) addressed many of the earlier review findings well — CSRF state parameter, algorithm pinning, fragment-based token redirect, fresh guild fetching, `isGuildAdmin` consolidation, and `getPermissionError` level parameter are all solid improvements.\\n\\n**Remaining issues:**\\n\\n**🔴 Critical (1)**\\n- **Discord access token stored in plaintext JWT** (`src/api/routes/auth.js:126-136`): The Discord OAuth2 access token is embedded directly in the JWT payload. JWTs are signed but not encrypted — anyone who obtains the token can base64-decode it and extract the raw Discord access token. Store the access token server-side instead.\\n\\n**🟡 Warning (3)**\\n- **Missing `requireGuildAdmin` on stats/members/moderation routes** (`src/api/routes/guilds.js`): Config and actions endpoints correctly have the middleware, but `/:id/stats`, `/:id/members`, and `/:id/moderation` do not. Any OAuth user can access sensitive data for any guild.\\n- **`oauthStates` map grows unboundedly** (`src/api/routes/auth.js:16-28`): Cleanup only runs on new OAuth redirects.

The guard/bypass ordering mirrors `isAdmin`, which is consistent.\\n\\n---\\n\\n`132-141`: **`getPermissionError` update is clean.**\\n\\nThe `level` parameter with a sensible default provides flexible, user-facing error messages without breaking existing callers.\\n\\n\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\u003c/details\\u003e\\n\\u003cdetails\\u003e\\n\\u003csummary\\u003etests/api/routes/guilds.test.js (3)\\u003c/summary\\u003e\\u003cblockquote\\u003e\\n\\n`93-99`: **Good test isolation with cleanup of shared state.**\\n\\nClearing `sessionStore`, `guildCache`, mocks, env stubs, and restoring spies ensures no leakage between tests.\\n\\n---\\n\\n`136-146`: **JWT Bearer authentication test is well-constructed.**\\n\\nThe SESSION_SECRET env stub matches the signing secret used in `createOAuthToken`, and the test correctly validates that the Bearer token is accepted as an alternative to the `x-api-secret` header.\\n\\n---\\n\\n`158-195`: **GET `/` tests cover the key authorization matrix well.**\\n\\nThe three tests verify: (1) API-secret gets unfiltered results, (2) OAuth gets only admin+bot-present guilds, and (3) OAuth with no admin perms gets empty results. The use of `permissions: '8'` (ADMINISTRATOR bitmask) vs `'0'` is correct for Discord's permission model.\\n\\n\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\u003c/details\\u003e\\n\\u003cdetails\\u003e\\n\\u003csummary\\u003etests/api/routes/auth.test.js (3)\\u003c/summary\\u003e\\u003cblockquote\\u003e\\n\\n`1-34`: **Test setup is clean and minimal.**\\n\\nLogger mock, lightweight client stub, and proper cleanup in `afterEach` are all correct.

Update\\nthe block that currently does \\\"if (!sessionSecret) { return res.status(401)...\\n}\\\" to log a clear error including the missing SESSION_SECRET (use the existing\\nlogger variable in this module, or console.error if none) and respond with\\nres.status(500). Keep the response body similar (e.g., { error: 'Session not\\nconfigured' }) but ensure an error log is emitted before sending the 500.\\n\\nIn `@src/api/middleware/oauth.js`:\\n- Around line 26-28: The error log for the missing SESSION_SECRET (the call to\\nerror(...) when sessionSecret is falsy in oauth middleware) should include\\nstructured Winston metadata: update the error(...) invocation to pass an object\\nwith request context like { method: req.method, url: req.originalUrl || req.url,\\nip: req.ip, headers: req.headers \\u0026\\u0026 { host: req.headers.host },\\nsessionConfigured: false } so the log includes request-scoped details and a flag\\nindicating session config; keep the existing message string but add this\\nmetadata object as the second argument before returning the\\nres.status(500).json(...) response.\\n\\nIn `@src/api/routes/auth.js`:\\n- Around line 16-17: sessionStore currently holds raw entries and grows without\\neviction; implement TTL-based entries and periodic cleanup similar to\\noauthStates. Change sessionStore to map userId → { accessToken, createdAt } (or\\nexpiresAt) and update code that writes to it (login flow) to store the\\ntimestamp; update the logout handler to remove the userId from sessionStore; add\\na cleanup job (setInterval) that iterates sessionStore and deletes entries older\\nthan the chosen TTL (e.g., 1 hour, matching JWT expiry); ensure any code that\\nreads sessionStore (token refresh or auth checks) respects the expiry and\\nremoves stale entries.\\n- Around line 147-157: The jwt.sign call that creates `token` omits the explicit\\nsigning algorithm; update the `jwt.sign` invocation (the token creation block\\nusing `jwt.sign` and `sessionSecret`) to include the option `{ algorithm:\\n'HS256' }` alongside `expiresIn: '1h'` so it explicitly matches the verification\\ncode that uses `algorithms: ['HS256']`.\\n- Around line 200-205: The logout route currently just returns a JSON message\\nbut doesn't revoke the server-side session stored in sessionStore; update the\\nrouter.post('/logout', ...) handler to remove the user's session/Discord access\\ntoken from sessionStore (use whichever key you use elsewhere — e.g.,\\nreq.user.id, req.sessionID, or the JWT subject) before returning the response,\\nhandle the sessionStore removal as an async operation or check its return value\\nand log or return an error if deletion fails, and ensure the route still\\nresponds with the success message only after the session has been cleared.\\n\\nIn `@src/api/routes/guilds.js`:\\n- Around line 74-83: fetchUserGuilds currently returns an empty array on any\\nnon-OK Discord response which causes isOAuthGuildAdmin/requireGuildAdmin to\\ntreat API failures as “no guilds” and return a misleading 403; change\\nfetchUserGuilds to throw an error (including response status/text) when\\nresponse.ok is false so callers can distinguish failure from an empty list, and\\nupdate requireGuildAdmin (or its caller) to catch that specific fetch error and\\ntranslate it into a 502 response (with an appropriate message) instead of a 403;\\nreference the functions fetchUserGuilds and requireGuildAdmin/isOAuthGuildAdmin\\nwhen making these changes.\\n\\nIn `@src/utils/permissions.js`:\\n- Around line 61-66: The early return guard in hasPermission currently returns\\nfalse when config is null before checking isBotOwner, making bot-owner bypass\\nunreachable; update hasPermission so the bot-owner check (call to isBotOwner)\\nruns before or regardless of the config null/undefined guard (e.g., validate\\nmember and commandName first, then if isBotOwner(member, config) return true,\\nand only afterwards return false if config is missing or perform other\\npermission checks) to mirror the isAdmin pattern.\\n\\nIn `@tests/api/routes/auth.test.js`:\\n- Around line 173-180: Test currently only asserts a 200 and message for the\\n'POST /api/v1/auth/logout' endpoint; update the test to (1) create a logged-in\\nsession (add a session entry to sessionStore or obtain a valid token via the\\nlogin helper), call the logout route with that token, then assert the\\nsessionStore no longer contains that session (or token is invalidated), and (2)\\nassert the endpoint enforces auth by calling it without a token and expecting a\\n401/unauthorized response; reference the POST /api/v1/auth/logout test, the\\nsessionStore object, and the auth middleware/token helper to locate where to add\\nthese assertions.\\n- Around line 87-171: Add a test case to verify the /api/v1/auth/me route\\nrejects revoked/missing server-side sessions: in auth.test.js create a test\\n(e.g., \\\"should return 401 when session is revoked/missing\\\") that stubs\\nSESSION_SECRET, signs a JWT for userId '123' with

`@tests/api/routes/guilds.test.js`:\\n- Around line 101-120: The fetch mock in mockFetchGuilds is using\\nvi.spyOn(...).mockResolvedValue (persistent) which can hide extra fetch calls;\\nchange mockResolvedValue to mockResolvedValueOnce in the mockFetchGuilds helper\\nso each test gets a single-use response (or explicitly chain multiple\\nmockResolvedValueOnce calls when a test expects

is failing due to 3 Biome formatting violations in test files. These must be fixed before merge.\\n\\n**🔴 CI Failures (3)**\\n1. `tests/api/routes/auth.test.js:198-201` — multi-line `jwt.sign` call should be collapsed to single line\\n2. `tests/api/routes/guilds.test.js:151-154` — same formatting issue\\n3. `tests/commands/config.test.js:188-190, 217-219` — incorrect indentation inside `mockImplementationOnce` arrow function body\\n\\n**🟡 Warning (1)**\\n4. `src/api/routes/auth.js:89-91` — `stopAuthCleanup()` only clears the `stateCleanupInterval` but not `sessionCleanupInterval`. `stopSessionCleanup()` is exported (line 97) but never imported or called during server shutdown, so the session cleanup interval leaks on shutdown.\\n\\n**🔵 Nitpick (2)**\\n5. `src/api/routes/auth.js:93-99` — `stopSessionCleanup` is dead code (exported but never imported). Fold its logic into `stopAuthCleanup` and remove the unused export.\\n6. `src/api/routes/guilds.js:58` — `guildCache` never proactively evicts expired entries; stale entries accumulate for users who don't make repeat requests.\",\"commit_id\":\"2ea7ea4e5d4c9c9ae1cd998574a2c581ae5b33ae\",\"html_url\":\"https://github.com/BillChirico/bills-bot/pull/73#pullrequestreview-3815248844\",\"id\":3815248844,\"node_id\":\"PRR_kwDORICdSM7jaBPM\",\"pull_request_url\":\"https://api.github.com/repos/BillChirico/bills-bot/pulls/73\",\"state\":\"CHANGES_REQUESTED\",\"submitted_at\":\"2026-02-17T17:21:11Z\",\"user\":{\"avatar_url\":\"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1236702?v=4\",\"events_url\":\"https://api.github.com/users/claude%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}\",\"followers_url\":\"https://api.github.com/users/claude%5Bbot%5D/followers\",\"following_url\":\"https://api.github.com/users/claude%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}\",\"gists_url\":\"https://api.github.com/users/claude%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}\",\"gravatar_id\":\"\",\"html_url\":\"https://github.com/apps/claude\",\"id\":209825114,\"login\":\"claude[bot]\",\"node_id\":\"BOT_kgDODIGtWg\",\"organizations_url\":\"https://api.github.com/users/claude%5Bbot%5D/orgs\",\"received_events_url\":\"https://api.github.com/users/claude%5Bbot%5D/received_events\",\"repos_url\":\"https://api.github.com/users/claude%5Bbot%5D/repos\",\"site_admin\":false,\"starred_url\":\"https://api.github.com/users/claude%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}\",\"subscriptions_url\":\"https://api.github.com/users/claude%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions\",\"type\":\"Bot\",\"url\":\"https://api.github.com/users/claude%5Bbot%5D\",\"user_view_type\":\"public\"}},{\"_links\":{\"html\":{\"href\":\"https://github.com/BillChirico/bills-bot/pull/73#pullrequestreview-3815265091\"},\"pull_request\":{\"href\":\"https://api.github.com/repos/BillChirico/bills-bot/pulls/73\"}},\"author_association\":\"NONE\",\"body\":\"LGTM — all critical and major issues from prior reviews have been addressed.
