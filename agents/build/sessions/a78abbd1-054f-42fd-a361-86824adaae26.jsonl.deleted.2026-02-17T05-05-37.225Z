Worktree: git worktree add /tmp/bills-bot-feat-rest-api -b feat/rest-api\nCLAUDE CODE for ALL code: `claude --model opus --effort high --dangerously-skip-permissions '<task>'`\nCODESESSION: cs start → cs log-ai → cs note → cs end\n\nTASK: Web Dashboard REST API Layer (Issue #29)\nISSUE: https://github.com/BillChirico/bills-bot/issues/29\nREPO: /home/bill/.openclaw/workspace-build/bills-bot/\n\nDESCRIPTION: Add a REST API to the bills-bot process that the web dashboard consumes. The bot currently has NO HTTP server — it's a pure Discord WebSocket client. This adds an Express server running alongside the Discord client.\n\nARCHITECTURE:\n- Express server starts in src/index.js alongside Discord client (after DB init)\n- Listens on BOT_API_PORT (default 3001)\n- All routes under /api/v1/ prefix\n- Auth via shared secret (BOT_API_SECRET header) — the Next.js dashboard backend calls the bot API server-side, not from the browser\n- The web dashboard already has Discord OAuth — it verifies the user, then calls the bot API with the shared secret\n\nENDPOINTS TO IMPLEMENT:\n1. GET /api/v1/health — server health (uptime, memory, discord status)\n2. GET /api/v1/guilds/:id — server info (name, icon, member count, channels) via Discord client\n3. GET /api/v1/guilds/:id/config — read config via getConfig()\n4. PATCH /api/v1/guilds/:id/config — update config via setConfigValue()\n5. GET /api/v1/guilds/:id/stats — AI usage stats, message counts, uptime\n6. GET /api/v1/guilds/:id/members — member list with roles (paginated)\n7. GET /api/v1/guilds/:id/moderation — warnings, mod actions from DB (paginated)\n8. POST /api/v1/guilds/:id/actions — bot actions (send message to channel, etc.)\n\nFILE STRUCTURE:\n- src/api/server.js — Express app setup, middleware, start/stop\n- src/api/middleware/auth.js — BOT_API_SECRET verification\n- src/api/middleware/rateLimit.js — per-IP rate limiting\n- src/api/routes/health.js — health endpoint\n- src/api/routes/guilds.js — guild info, config, stats, members, moderation, actions\n- src/api/index.js — router aggregation\n\nMIDDLEWARE:\n- Auth: check `x-api-secret` header matches BOT_API_SECRET env var\n- Rate limiting: simple in-memory rate limiter (no external deps if possible, or use express-rate-limit)\n- CORS: allow dashboard origin (DASHBOARD_URL env var)\n- JSON body parsing\n- Error handling middleware (catch-all, returns JSON errors)\n\nIMPORTANT DETAILS:\n- Express is NOT in package.json yet — you'll need to `pnpm add express`\n- The Discord client instance needs to be accessible from route handlers — pass it via app.locals or a module-level setter\n- Use existing modules: getConfig/setConfigValue from src/modules/config.js, db pool from src/db.js\n- Winston logger only — no console.* in src/ (Biome rule)\n- ESM imports (no require())\n- JSDoc on all exports\n- Parameterized queries for any DB access\n- Guild ID validation — verify the bot is actually in the guild\n- Pagination: use ?page=1&limit=25 query params with sensible defaults and caps\n\nENV VARS (add to .env.example):\n- BOT_API_PORT=3001\n- BOT_API_SECRET=your_secret_here\n- DASHBOARD_URL=http://localhost:3000\n\nINTEGRATION WITH INDEX.JS:\n- Import and start the API server after DB init and Discord login\n- Pass the Discord client and DB pool to the server\n- Add graceful shutdown for the HTTP server (before DB close)\n\nTESTS:\n- Test each endpoint (mock Discord client, mock DB pool)\n- Test auth middleware (missing secret, wrong secret, valid secret)\n- Test rate limiting\n- Test error handling\n- 80%+ coverage\n\nCreate PR when done.

Follow it exactly.\n> **If you're Pip Build main session:** This documents what sub-agents must do.\n\n## 1. Codesession Tracking (MANDATORY — DO NOT SKIP)\n\nTrack the ENTIRE session — no exceptions. Always use `--json` on every `cs` command.\n**If you skip any of these steps, the session is incomplete and Bill will notice.**\n\n### How It Works (v2.1.0+)\n\nCodesession resolves sessions by **CWD / git root**. As long as each sub-agent runs from its own worktree, parallel sessions just work — no `--session <id>` needed. All commands (`start`, `log-ai`, `note`, `status`, `end`) auto-resolve to the correct session based on your working directory.\n\n### Step-by-step (EVERY sub-agent session):\n\n**FIRST THING — start session FROM THE WORKTREE DIRECTORY:**\n\n```bash\ncd /tmp/bills-bot-<branch>   # MUST be in worktree dir so cs tracks the right git root\ncs start \"task description\" --json\n```\n\n⚠️ If you run `cs start` from the wrong directory, file changes and commits won't be tracked.\n⚠️ `cs start` only blocks if there's already an active session for the same directory/git root.\n\n**After EVERY Claude Code invocation**, log the AI call:\n\n```bash\ncs log-ai -p anthropic -m claude-opus-4-6 --prompt-tokens <n> --completion-tokens <n> --json\n```\n\n⚠️ **THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT STEP.** If you skip `cs log-ai`, the session shows 0 tokens and 0 cost — making it look like nothing happened. Extract token counts from Claude Code output. If you can't get exact numbers, estimate. **NEVER skip this.**\n\n**At every meaningful step** (starting work, reading code, found an issue, making changes, tests passing, pushing, etc.):\n\n```bash\ncs note \"detailed description of what you're doing and why\" --json\n```\n\n**Be verbose** — don't write \"working on memory module\", write \"adding opt-out toggle to /memory command — storing state in Set + JSON persistence, wiring into extractAndStoreMemories skip logic\". Minimum 3-5 notes per session. We need full visibility.\n\n**Before expensive operations** (large refactors, multiple Claude Code calls):\n\n```bash\ncs status --json   # check aiCost field, warn if > $5\n```\n\n**LAST THING you do (after all work is done, pushed, threads resolved):**\n\n```bash\ncs end -n \"detailed summary: files changed, tests added/modified, coverage numbers, commit SHAs, what was done\" --json\n```\n\n### Checklist — verify you did ALL of these:\n\n- [ ] `cd` into worktree BEFORE `cs start`\n- [ ] `cs start` at the very beginning\n- [ ] Stay in the worktree dir for ALL `cs` commands (auto-resolves to correct session)\n- [ ] `cs log-ai` after EVERY AI/Claude Code call (non-negotiable — 0 tokens = broken session)\n- [ ] `cs note` with detailed descriptions at meaningful steps (minimum 3-5 per session)\n- [ ] `cs status` before expensive ops\n- [ ] `cs end` with detailed summary at the very end\n- [ ] Final check: `cs status --json` — verify aiTokens > 0 and filesChanged > 0\n\nRead `skills/codesession/SKILL.md` for full details.\n\n## 2. Claude Code (MANDATORY — NON-NEGOTIABLE)\n\nUse `claude` CLI for ALL programming work. Do NOT hand-write code patches using edit/write tools.\n**ALWAYS use `--model opus`** — Claude Code defaults to Sonnet without it. Opus is required, no exceptions.\n\n```bash\nexec pty:true workdir:<project-dir> command:\"claude --model opus --effort high --dangerously-skip-permissions '<task description>'\"\n```\n\n- **`--model opus --effort high --dangerously-skip-permissions` is REQUIRED on every `claude` invocation** — this is non-negotiable\n- Monitor with `process:log`, don't hand-code patches\n- Agent Teams enabled (`~/.claude/settings.json`) — use for parallel work\n- After Claude Code finishes, log token usage with `cs log-ai`\n- If you write code directly with edit/write tools instead of using `claude` CLI, the session is invalid\n\n## 3. Git Workflow\n\n- **Git worktrees MANDATORY** — NEVER checkout branches in the main repo directory. Always create a worktree:\n  ```bash\n  cd /home/bill/.openclaw/workspace-build/bills-bot\n  git worktree add /tmp/bills-bot-<branch-name> -b <branch-name>\n  cd /tmp/bills-bot-<branch-name>\n  # Do all work here. Clean up when done:\n  git worktree remove /tmp/bills-bot-<branch-name>\n  ```\n  This keeps parallel sub-agents isolated. NON-NEGOTIABLE.\n- **Feature branches only** — never commit directly to main\n- **Conventional commits** — `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`\n- **PRs mandatory** for shared repos\n- **One commit per review comment** on PR review tasks\n- **Check for outdated packages** before every PR (`pnpm outdated`)\n- **80% test coverage mandatory** — statements, branches, functions, lines\n- **Always fix nitpick comments** — unless they don't make sense, would break things, or are redundant\n\n## 4. Board Comments (when task has a board ID)\n\n```bash\n# Start timer BEFORE working:\nvk begin <taskId>\n\n# Comment at EVERY meaningful step (not just start/end):\nvk comment <taskId> \"Starting work — reading codebase\" --author \"Pip Code\"\nvk comment <taskId> \"Found issue in X — applying fix\" --author \"Pip Code\"\nvk comment <taskId> \"Tests passing, committing\" --author \"Pip Code\"\n\n# When done:\nvk done <taskId> \"summary of work\" --author \"Pip Code\"\n```\n\nDo NOT mark a task done until ALL `verificationSteps` are met.\n\n- While executing a board task, keep **subtasks** updated in real time (mark completed ones as checked/done).\n- Keep **done criteria / verificationSteps** updated in real time (check each item as it is verified).\n- Final `vk done` only after subtasks and verificationSteps are accurately checked off.\n- **End-of-task requirement:** before closing, explicitly verify every done-criteria item is both (a) actually completed in the work and (b) marked completed in the board.\n- **Merge Conflict Check:** before finishing, check for merge conflicts with the target branch and fix them if they exist.\n\n## 5. PR Review Thread Resolution\n\nAfter fixing each review comment, resolve the thread on GitHub:\n\n```bash\ngh api graphql -f query='mutation { resolveReviewThread(input: {threadId: \"THREAD_ID\"}) { thread { isResolved } } }'\n```\n\n**⚠️ PAGINATION IS MANDATORY when fetching threads.** GitHub GraphQL `reviewThreads(first:100)` returns max 100 per page. If a PR has 100+ threads, you MUST paginate using `pageInfo{hasNextPage endCursor}` and loop with `after:` cursor. We once missed 22 threads because we only fetched page 1. Use this pattern:\n\n```bash\n# Fetch ALL unresolved threads across all pages\nCURSOR=\"\"\nwhile true; do\n  if [ -z \"$CURSOR\" ]; then\n    QUERY=\"reviewThreads(first:100)\"\n  else\n    QUERY=\"reviewThreads(first:100,after:\\\"$CURSOR\\\")\"\n  fi\n  # ... fetch, collect unresolved threads, check hasNextPage, update CURSOR\n  # Break when hasNextPage is false\ndone\n```\n\nDo **not** post a summary comment on the GitHub PR unless Bill explicitly asks.\n\nInstead, report completion details back to the parent agent (what was fixed, commits, tests, thread resolution), and let the parent agent report to Bill.\n\n- **Merge Conflict Check:** before finishing, check for merge conflicts with the target branch and fix them if they exist.\n\nThis does **not** change board behavior: for board-linked tasks, continue posting verbose board comments (`vk comment ... --author \"Pip Code\"`) and keeping subtasks/done-criteria updated.\n\n## 6. Testing\n\n- Run `pnpm test` — all tests must pass\n- Coverage must stay above 80% on all metrics\n- New code must include tests\n- Use `vitest` — project is already configured\n\n## 7. Code Standards\n\n- **Winston logger only** — NEVER use `console.*` in src/ files (Biome `noConsole: error`)\n- **Keep docs up to date** — README.md, AGENTS.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, .env.example\n- **bills-bot stack:** Node.js ESM, discord.js v14, pnpm, Biome, vitest\n\n## Key Paths\n\n- **bills-bot repo:** `/home/bill/.openclaw/workspace-build/bills-bot/`\n- **Board API:** `http://localhost:3001`\n- **Board CLI:** `vk <command>`\n"}],"isError":false,"timestamp":1771301087626}}

This adds an Express HTTP server that runs alongside the Discord WebSocket client.\n\n## WHAT TO DO\n\n### 1. Install Express\nRun: pnpm add express\n\n### 2. Create API files\n\n**src/api/server.js** — Express app setup:\n- Creates Express app with JSON body parsing, CORS (allow DASHBOARD_URL env var origin), error handling middleware\n- Exports startServer(client, dbPool) and stopServer() functions\n- Stores client and dbPool in app.locals so route handlers can access them\n- Listens on BOT_API_PORT env var (default 3001)\n- Use winston logger (import from ../logger.js) — NEVER use console.*\n\n**src/api/middleware/auth.js** — Auth middleware:\n- Checks x-api-secret header matches BOT_API_SECRET env var\n- Returns 401 JSON error if missing or wrong\n- JSDoc on exports\n\n**src/api/middleware/rateLimit.js** — Rate limiting:\n- Simple in-memory rate limiter (no external deps)\n- Per-IP, configurable window and max requests\n- Returns 429 JSON error when exceeded\n- JSDoc on exports\n\n**src/api/routes/health.js** — Express Router:\n- GET / — returns { status: \"ok\", uptime: process.uptime(), memory: process.memoryUsage(), discord: { status, ping, guilds } }\n\n**src/api/routes/guilds.js** — Express Router with guild ID validation middleware:\n- Validate guild ID: check bot is actually in that guild via client.guilds.cache.get(id), return 404 if not\n- GET /:id — guild info (name, icon, memberCount, channels list)\n- GET /:id/config — read config via getConfig() from src/modules/config.js\n- PATCH /:id/config — update config via setConfigValue() from src/modules/config.js. Body: { path: \"ai.model\", value: \"claude-3\" }\n- GET /:id/stats — query DB for AI usage stats (count from conversations table), message counts, uptime. Use parameterized queries.\n- GET /:id/members — paginated member list with roles. Query params: ?page=1&limit=25 (max 100). Use guild.members.fetch() with limit.\n- GET /:id/moderation — paginated mod cases from mod_cases table. Query params: ?page=1&limit=25 (max 100). Use parameterized DB queries.\n- POST /:id/actions — bot actions. Body: { action: \"sendMessage\", channelId: \"...\", content: \"...\" }. Validate channelId belongs to guild.\n\n**src/api/index.js** — Router aggregation:\n- Mounts health router at /health\n- Mounts guilds router at /guilds\n- Exports the combined v1 router\n\n### 3. Integrate into src/index.js\n\nIn the startup() function, AFTER Discord client.login(token) resolves:\n- Import { startServer } from ./api/server.js\n- Call startServer(client, dbPool) — store the return value\n\nIn gracefulShutdown():\n- Import { stopServer } from ./api/server.js\n- Call stopServer() BEFORE closing DB pool (add it as step 1.5, after stopping timers but before saving state)\n\n### 4. Update .env.example\nAdd these env vars with comments (the file already has BOT_API_SECRET):\n- BOT_API_PORT=3001\n- DASHBOARD_URL=http://localhost:3000\nPut them in the \"Web Dashboard\" section.\n\n### 5. Write tests\n\nCreate tests/api/ directory with test files:\n- tests/api/server.test.js — test server start/stop\n- tests/api/middleware/auth.test.js — test auth (missing secret, wrong secret, valid secret)\n- tests/api/middleware/rateLimit.test.js — test rate limiting\n- tests/api/routes/health.test.js — test health endpoint\n- tests/api/routes/guilds.test.js — test all guild endpoints\n\nFor tests:\n- Mock Discord client: { guilds: { cache: new Map(...) }, ws: { ping: 42 }, user: { tag: \"bot#1234\" } }\n- Mock guild object with appropriate properties and methods\n- Mock DB pool with query method returning appropriate rows\n- Mock getConfig/setConfigValue\n- Use supertest or direct HTTP requests to test endpoints\n- Import express and create test instances of the app\n\nRun `pnpm test` to verify all tests pass.\nRun `pnpm test:coverage` and ensure 80%+ coverage on all API files.\nRun `pnpm lint` and fix any Biome errors.\n\n## IMPORTANT RULES\n- ESM imports only (no require())\n- Winston logger only (import from ../logger.js or ../../logger.js) — NEVER use console.*\n- JSDoc on all exported functions\n- Parameterized queries for ALL database access (no string interpolation in SQL)\n- Conventional commit messages\n- All routes return JSON responses\n- Proper HTTP status codes (200, 201, 400, 401, 404, 429, 500)\n- Pagination helper: parse page/limit from query, apply defaults (page=1, limit=25), cap limit at 100\n\n## EXISTING CODE PATTERNS\n- getConfig() returns the full config object\n- setConfigValue(path, value) takes dot-notation path and value\n- getPool() returns pg.Pool instance\n- Logger exports: info, error, warn from src/logger.js\n- DB tables: config, conversations, mod_cases, mod_scheduled_actions\n- Tests use vitest, files are in tests/ directory mirroring src/ structure'","timeout":600,"pty":true}}],"api":"anthropic-messages","provider":"anthropic","model":"claude-opus-4-6","usage":{"input":1,"output":1492,"cacheRead":28405,"cacheWrite":486,"totalTokens":30384,"cost":{"input":0.000005,"output":0.0373,"cacheRead":0.0142025,"cacheWrite":0.0030375000000000003,"total":0.054544999999999996}},"stopReason":"toolUse","timestamp":1771301116018}}

Worktree: git worktree add /tmp/bills-bot-feat-rest-api -b feat/rest-api\nCLAUDE CODE for ALL code: `claude --model opus --effort high --dangerously-skip-permissions '<task>'`\nCODESESSION: cs start → cs log-ai → cs note → cs end\n\nTASK: Web Dashboard REST API Layer (Issue #29)\nISSUE: https://github.com/BillChirico/bills-bot/issues/29\nREPO: /home/bill/.openclaw/workspace-build/bills-bot/\n\nDESCRIPTION: Add a REST API to the bills-bot process that the web dashboard consumes. The bot currently has NO HTTP server — it's a pure Discord WebSocket client. This adds an Express server running alongside the Discord client.\n\nARCHITECTURE:\n- Express server starts in src/index.js alongside Discord client (after DB init)\n- Listens on BOT_API_PORT (default 3001)\n- All routes under /api/v1/ prefix\n- Auth via shared secret (BOT_API_SECRET header) — the Next.js dashboard backend calls the bot API server-side, not from the browser\n- The web dashboard already has Discord OAuth — it verifies the user, then calls the bot API with the shared secret\n\nENDPOINTS TO IMPLEMENT:\n1. GET /api/v1/health — server health (uptime, memory, discord status)\n2. GET /api/v1/guilds/:id — server info (name, icon, member count, channels) via Discord client\n3. GET /api/v1/guilds/:id/config — read config via getConfig()\n4. PATCH /api/v1/guilds/:id/config — update config via setConfigValue()\n5. GET /api/v1/guilds/:id/stats — AI usage stats, message counts, uptime\n6. GET /api/v1/guilds/:id/members — member list with roles (paginated)\n7. GET /api/v1/guilds/:id/moderation — warnings, mod actions from DB (paginated)\n8. POST /api/v1/guilds/:id/actions — bot actions (send message to channel, etc.)\n\nFILE STRUCTURE:\n- src/api/server.js — Express app setup, middleware, start/stop\n- src/api/middleware/auth.js — BOT_API_SECRET verification\n- src/api/middleware/rateLimit.js — per-IP rate limiting\n- src/api/routes/health.js — health endpoint\n- src/api/routes/guilds.js — guild info, config, stats, members, moderation, actions\n- src/api/index.js — router aggregation\n\nMIDDLEWARE:\n- Auth: check `x-api-secret` header matches BOT_API_SECRET env var\n- Rate limiting: simple in-memory rate limiter (no external deps if possible, or use express-rate-limit)\n- CORS: allow dashboard origin (DASHBOARD_URL env var)\n- JSON body parsing\n- Error handling middleware (catch-all, returns JSON errors)\n\nIMPORTANT DETAILS:\n- Express is NOT in package.json yet — you'll need to `pnpm add express`\n- The Discord client instance needs to be accessible from route handlers — pass it via app.locals or a module-level setter\n- Use existing modules: getConfig/setConfigValue from src/modules/config.js, db pool from src/db.js\n- Winston logger only — no console.* in src/ (Biome rule)\n- ESM imports (no require())\n- JSDoc on all exports\n- Parameterized queries for any DB access\n- Guild ID validation — verify the bot is actually in the guild\n- Pagination: use ?page=1&limit=25 query params with sensible defaults and caps\n\nENV VARS (add to .env.example):\n- BOT_API_PORT=3001\n- BOT_API_SECRET=your_secret_here\n- DASHBOARD_URL=http://localhost:3000\n\nINTEGRATION WITH INDEX.JS:\n- Import and start the API server after DB init and Discord login\n- Pass the Discord client and DB pool to the server\n- Add graceful shutdown for the HTTP server (before DB close)\n\nTESTS:\n- Test each endpoint (mock Discord client, mock DB pool)\n- Test auth middleware (missing secret, wrong secret, valid secret)\n- Test rate limiting\n- Test error handling\n- 80%+ coverage\n\nCreate PR when done.
