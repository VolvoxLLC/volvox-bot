(ASP.NET, MVC, .NET Framework, etc…)?\r\n\r\nHow do you ensure the quality and maintainability of your code?\r\nI focus on clear architecture, SOLID principles, and readable, well-structured code. I rely on automated unit/integration tests, code reviews, static analysis, and consistent coding standards. I also maintain a balance on refactoring and documentation that help long term maintainability.\r\n\r\nWhich of the following .NET PDF libraries have you worked with:  Aspose, iTextSharp, IronPDF, or other (please explain)\r\nIn PDF generation and manipulation (complex layouts, inheriting forms, etc.) in .Net, I’ve mostly used iTextSharp. I have a solid understanding of the APIs and licensing models behind Aspose.PDF, which has included undertaking evaluations for enterprise use cases. I have not extensively used IronPDF, but I am aware of its appropriate use cases and limitations.\r\n\r\nWhat motivates you to do your best work?\r\nI’m motivated by solving meaningful problems, building reliable systems, and seeing my work deliver value to users and the business. Continuous improvement both technically and in collaboration and delivery is another value I hold.\r\n\r\nName a feature you would want to add to your personal choice of tax software or financial planning tool.\r\nAlso, I would add a proactive scenario-planning function that models tax outcomes and cash-flow impacts based on forthcoming events in life such as job changes, investments, or relocation with explainable assumptions rather than a black-box approach to results.\r\n\r\nIn a few sentences, describe a situation where you had to troubleshoot a difficult bug. What steps did you take to resolve it?\r\nI once had to debug an intermittent production issue that was caused by a race condition in a distributed caching layer. I debugged it using targeted logging and load testing, isolated the timing issue, and fixed it by correcting thread safety and adding safeguards. I also added monitoring to prevent regressions to occur.\r\n\r\nHow do you prioritize your tasks when you have multiple deadlines?\r\nFirst, I measure business impact, urgency, and dependencies. Then, I decide on the deliverable sequence to optimize work and communicate early about tradeoffs and risks. If priorities conflict, I align with stakeholders fairly quickly to set clear and realistic expectations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWithdraw this application\r\nhttps://k1x.workable.com/jobs/5521837/candidates/EOhrvZw_E-sYI1ZHLEFov5tuqBMgMLDP9OeI3yjBAws\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nPowered by Workable\r\nhttps://jobs.workable.com/\r\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS: Evaluate this email.
