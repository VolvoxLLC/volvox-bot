THREAD ID: PRRT_kwDORICdSM5u9fwP\n       FILE: src/api/routes/guilds.js LINE: 224\n       ISSUE: 🔴 CRITICAL (duplicate) — Content must be sanitized before sending to Discord.

THREAD ID: PRRT_kwDORICdSM5u9e9k\n       FILE: src/api/routes/guilds.js LINE: 96\n       ISSUE: 🟡 Config endpoint is not guild-scoped — PATCH /:id/config modifies global config, not per-guild.\n\n    5. THREAD ID: PRRT_kwDORICdSM5u9fwI\n       FILE: src/api/routes/guilds.js LINE: 71\n       ISSUE: 🟠 MAJOR (duplicate) — Config endpoints return global config, not guild-scoped config. GET /:id/config calls getConfig() which returns entire bot config regardless of guild ID.\n\n    6. THREAD ID: PRRT_kwDORICdSM5u9fGB\n       FILE: src/api/routes/guilds.js LINE: 71\n       ISSUE: 🟡 Config endpoint returns entire config including sensitive data (e.g. logging.database).\n\n    7.

THREAD ID: PRRT_kwDORICdSM5u9fBh\n       FILE: src/api/routes/guilds.js LINE: 137\n       ISSUE: 🟡 Pagination offset not used for Discord member fetch. Discord's fetch() uses cursor-based pagination (after param), not offset.\n\n    9. THREAD ID: PRRT_kwDORICdSM5u9fwM\n       FILE: src/api/routes/guilds.js LINE: 137\n       ISSUE: 🟠 MAJOR (duplicate) — Pagination page parameter is ineffective. guild.members.fetch({ limit }) doesn't support offset-based pagination.\n\n    10.

THREAD ID: PRRT_kwDORICdSM5u9fwS\n        FILE: src/api/routes/guilds.js LINE: 231\n        ISSUE: 🔵 Trivial (duplicate) — Same: avoid reflecting raw user input in error responses.\n\n    17. THREAD ID: PRRT_kwDORICdSM5u9fD2\n        FILE: src/api/server.js LINE: 43\n        ISSUE: 🔵 Nitpick — CORS allows all origins when DASHBOARD_URL is unset.

THREAD ID: PRRT_kwDORICdSM5u9fwZ\n        FILE: src/api/server.js LINE: 82\n        ISSUE: 🟡 Minor (duplicate) — Calling startServer twice leaks the first server.

THREAD ID: PRRT_kwDORICdSM5u9fwX\n        FILE: src/api/routes/health.js LINE: 27\n        ISSUE: 🟡 Minor — Health endpoint exposes detailed memory info without authentication. process.memoryUsage() data shouldn't be public.\n\n    22.

THREAD ID: PRRT_kwDORICdSM5u9fwc\n        FILE: src/index.js LINE: 458\n        ISSUE: 🟡 Minor — Consider resilience if API server fails to start. startServer() rejection propagates to startup().catch() and kills the bot.\n\n    24.
