The next step in our process consists of two parts: first, a few pre-set questions you'll answer in a chat box, second, a quick phone call OR text exchange with our Virtual Recruiter, Jamie. We'll briefly cover some of the basics and ask about your history as it relates to the job. We also sent over a text message in case that is easier to begin the screening process.Â Â Â When you are ready to begin, please click the \"Start Chat\" button below, where you'll be directed to our main webpage chat box. If we have positions that match your profile, we will get you routed to our in house recruiting team! Should you experience any issues during this process, please reach out to let us know so we can help! Contact us directly HERE.Â \r\nÂ Thanks!\r\n\r\n    @media screen and (max-width: 599px)\r\n    {\r\n        [class].hf-td {\r\n            width: 100% !important;\r\n            display: block !important;\r\n        }\r\n        u + .body.hf-td {\r\n            width: 100% !important;\r\n            display: block !important;\r\n        }\r\n        body[data-outlook-cycle] .container {\r\n            width: 480px !important;\r\n        }\r\n        .hf-td a {\r\n            box-sizing: border-box;\r\n            font-size: 16px !important;\r\n            font-weight: bold;\r\n            margin: 8px 0px !important;\r\n        }\r\n        .hf-container-padding {\r\n            width: 100% !important;\r\n            box-sizing: border-box;\r\n            padding: 0px !important;\r\n        }\r\n        .hf-container-padding a {\r\n            display: block !important;\r\n            margin: 0px 0px 15px 0px !important;\r\n            box-sizing: border-box;\r\n            font-size: 14px!important;\r\n            font-weight: bold;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    @media screen and (max-width: 400px)\r\n    {\r\n      .ms-table-td {\r\n        width: 100% !important;\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStart Chat\n\nINSTRUCTIONS: Evaluate this email.
