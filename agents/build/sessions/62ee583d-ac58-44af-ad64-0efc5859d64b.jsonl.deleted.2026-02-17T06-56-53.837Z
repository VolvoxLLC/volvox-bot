Follow it exactly.\n> **If you're Pip Build main session:** This documents what sub-agents must do.\n\n## 1. Codesession Tracking (MANDATORY — DO NOT SKIP)\n\nTrack the ENTIRE session — no exceptions. Always use `--json` on every `cs` command.\n**If you skip any of these steps, the session is incomplete and Bill will notice.**\n\n### How It Works (v2.1.0+)\n\nCodesession resolves sessions by **CWD / git root**. As long as each sub-agent runs from its own worktree, parallel sessions just work — no `--session <id>` needed. All commands (`start`, `log-ai`, `note`, `status`, `end`) auto-resolve to the correct session based on your working directory.\n\n### Step-by-step (EVERY sub-agent session):\n\n**FIRST THING — start session FROM THE WORKTREE DIRECTORY:**\n\n```bash\ncd /tmp/bills-bot-<branch>   # MUST be in worktree dir so cs tracks the right git root\ncs start \"task description\" --json\n```\n\n⚠️ If you run `cs start` from the wrong directory, file changes and commits won't be tracked.\n⚠️ `cs start` only blocks if there's already an active session for the same directory/git root.\n\n**After EVERY Claude Code invocation**, log the AI call:\n\n```bash\ncs log-ai -p anthropic -m claude-opus-4-6 --prompt-tokens <n> --completion-tokens <n> --json\n```\n\n⚠️ **THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT STEP.** If you skip `cs log-ai`, the session shows 0 tokens and 0 cost — making it look like nothing happened. Extract token counts from Claude Code output. If you can't get exact numbers, estimate. **NEVER skip this.**\n\n**At every meaningful step** (starting work, reading code, found an issue, making changes, tests passing, pushing, etc.):\n\n```bash\ncs note \"detailed description of what you're doing and why\" --json\n```\n\n**Be verbose** — don't write \"working on memory module\", write \"adding opt-out toggle to /memory command — storing state in Set + JSON persistence, wiring into extractAndStoreMemories skip logic\". Minimum 3-5 notes per session. We need full visibility.\n\n**Before expensive operations** (large refactors, multiple Claude Code calls):\n\n```bash\ncs status --json   # check aiCost field, warn if > $5\n```\n\n**LAST THING you do (after all work is done, pushed, threads resolved):**\n\n```bash\ncs end -n \"detailed summary: files changed, tests added/modified, coverage numbers, commit SHAs, what was done\" --json\n```\n\n### Checklist — verify you did ALL of these:\n\n- [ ] `cd` into worktree BEFORE `cs start`\n- [ ] `cs start` at the very beginning\n- [ ] Stay in the worktree dir for ALL `cs` commands (auto-resolves to correct session)\n- [ ] `cs log-ai` after EVERY AI/Claude Code call (non-negotiable — 0 tokens = broken session)\n- [ ] `cs note` with detailed descriptions at meaningful steps (minimum 3-5 per session)\n- [ ] `cs status` before expensive ops\n- [ ] `cs end` with detailed summary at the very end\n- [ ] Final check: `cs status --json` — verify aiTokens > 0 and filesChanged > 0\n\nRead `skills/codesession/SKILL.md` for full details.\n\n## 2. Claude Code (MANDATORY — NON-NEGOTIABLE)\n\nUse `claude` CLI for ALL programming work. Do NOT hand-write code patches using edit/write tools.\n**ALWAYS use `--model opus`** — Claude Code defaults to Sonnet without it. Opus is required, no exceptions.\n\n```bash\nexec pty:true workdir:<project-dir> command:\"claude --model opus --effort high --dangerously-skip-permissions '<task description>'\"\n```\n\n- **`--model opus --effort high --dangerously-skip-permissions` is REQUIRED on every `claude` invocation** — this is non-negotiable\n- Monitor with `process:log`, don't hand-code patches\n- Agent Teams enabled (`~/.claude/settings.json`) — use for parallel work\n- After Claude Code finishes, log token usage with `cs log-ai`\n- If you write code directly with edit/write tools instead of using `claude` CLI, the session is invalid\n\n## 3. Git Workflow\n\n- **Git worktrees MANDATORY** — NEVER checkout branches in the main repo directory. Always create a worktree:\n  ```bash\n  cd /home/bill/.openclaw/workspace-build/bills-bot\n  git worktree add /tmp/bills-bot-<branch-name> -b <branch-name>\n  cd /tmp/bills-bot-<branch-name>\n  # Do all work here. Clean up when done:\n  git worktree remove /tmp/bills-bot-<branch-name>\n  ```\n  This keeps parallel sub-agents isolated. NON-NEGOTIABLE.\n- **Feature branches only** — never commit directly to main\n- **Conventional commits** — `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`\n- **PRs mandatory** for shared repos\n- **One commit per review comment** on PR review tasks\n- **Check for outdated packages** before every PR (`pnpm outdated`)\n- **80% test coverage mandatory** — statements, branches, functions, lines\n- **Always fix nitpick comments** — unless they don't make sense, would break things, or are redundant\n\n## 4. Board Comments (when task has a board ID)\n\n```bash\n# Start timer BEFORE working:\nvk begin <taskId>\n\n# Comment at EVERY meaningful step (not just start/end):\nvk comment <taskId> \"Starting work — reading codebase\" --author \"Pip Code\"\nvk comment <taskId> \"Found issue in X — applying fix\" --author \"Pip Code\"\nvk comment <taskId> \"Tests passing, committing\" --author \"Pip Code\"\n\n# When done:\nvk done <taskId> \"summary of work\" --author \"Pip Code\"\n```\n\nDo NOT mark a task done until ALL `verificationSteps` are met.\n\n- While executing a board task, keep **subtasks** updated in real time (mark completed ones as checked/done).\n- Keep **done criteria / verificationSteps** updated in real time (check each item as it is verified).\n- Final `vk done` only after subtasks and verificationSteps are accurately checked off.\n- **End-of-task requirement:** before closing, explicitly verify every done-criteria item is both (a) actually completed in the work and (b) marked completed in the board.\n- **Merge Conflict Check:** before finishing, check for merge conflicts with the target branch and fix them if they exist.\n\n## 5. PR Review Thread Resolution\n\nAfter fixing each review comment, resolve the thread on GitHub:\n\n```bash\ngh api graphql -f query='mutation { resolveReviewThread(input: {threadId: \"THREAD_ID\"}) { thread { isResolved } } }'\n```\n\n**⚠️ PAGINATION IS MANDATORY when fetching threads.** GitHub GraphQL `reviewThreads(first:100)` returns max 100 per page. If a PR has 100+ threads, you MUST paginate using `pageInfo{hasNextPage endCursor}` and loop with `after:` cursor. We once missed 22 threads because we only fetched page 1. Use this pattern:\n\n```bash\n# Fetch ALL unresolved threads across all pages\nCURSOR=\"\"\nwhile true; do\n  if [ -z \"$CURSOR\" ]; then\n    QUERY=\"reviewThreads(first:100)\"\n  else\n    QUERY=\"reviewThreads(first:100,after:\\\"$CURSOR\\\")\"\n  fi\n  # ... fetch, collect unresolved threads, check hasNextPage, update CURSOR\n  # Break when hasNextPage is false\ndone\n```\n\nDo **not** post a summary comment on the GitHub PR unless Bill explicitly asks.\n\nInstead, report completion details back to the parent agent (what was fixed, commits, tests, thread resolution), and let the parent agent report to Bill.\n\n- **Merge Conflict Check:** before finishing, check for merge conflicts with the target branch and fix them if they exist.\n\nThis does **not** change board behavior: for board-linked tasks, continue posting verbose board comments (`vk comment ... --author \"Pip Code\"`) and keeping subtasks/done-criteria updated.\n\n## 6. Testing\n\n- Run `pnpm test` — all tests must pass\n- Coverage must stay above 80% on all metrics\n- New code must include tests\n- Use `vitest` — project is already configured\n\n## 7. Code Standards\n\n- **Winston logger only** — NEVER use `console.*` in src/ files (Biome `noConsole: error`)\n- **Keep docs up to date** — README.md, AGENTS.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, .env.example\n- **bills-bot stack:** Node.js ESM, discord.js v14, pnpm, Biome, vitest\n\n## Key Paths\n\n- **bills-bot repo:** `/home/bill/.openclaw/workspace-build/bills-bot/`\n- **Board API:** `http://localhost:3001`\n- **Board CLI:** `vk <command>`\n"}],"isError":false,"timestamp":1771307818147}}

Let me summarize the issues and their fixes:\n\n**UNIQUE ISSUES (removing duplicates):**\n\n1. **PRRT_kwDORICdSM5u9s0z** - conversations count not guild-scoped (line 133 in guilds.js)\n   - Looking at the stats endpoint, the query is `SELECT COUNT(*)::int AS count FROM conversations WHERE guild_id = $1` which IS guild-scoped. Let me check if this is still an issue.\n\n2. **PRRT_kwDORICdSM5u9s2M** - content length blocks safeSend splitting (line 240)\n   - Looking at line 229-243 (POST /:id/actions), the response echoes `sent.content`. The issue might be that when safeSend splits messages, we return the content of only the first message but that's already handled.\n\n3. **PRRT_kwDORICdSM5u9s2z** - DELETE in CORS but no DELETE routes (line 36 in server.js)\n   - CORS allows `GET, POST, PATCH, OPTIONS` but no DELETE. This is correct.\n\n4. **PRRT_kwDORICdSM5u9s6j** - Discord internals exposed unauthenticated (line 27 in health.js)\n   - The code shows `body.discord` is only added when authenticated. This seems fine.\n\n5. **PRRT_kwDORICdSM5u9s82** - vi.unstubAllEnvs in afterEach (line 53 in health.test.js)\n   - The test file has `vi.unstubAllEnvs()` in afterEach which is correct.\n\n6. **PRRT_kwDORICdSM5u9t-D** - response echoes original content (line 260 in guilds.js)\n   - This is the same as #2 - the POST /actions endpoint.\n\n7. **PRRT_kwDORICdSM5u9uGN** - logging in SAFE_CONFIG_KEYS (line 18 in guilds.js)\n   - SAFE_CONFIG_KEYS includes 'logging' which is a safe key to expose.\n\n8. **PRRT_kwDORICdSM5u9uOL** - duplicated timing-safe comparison (line 37 in health.js)\n   - The timing-safe comparison checks `secret.length === expected.length` and then uses `crypto.timingSafeEqual`. This is correct.\n\n9. **PRRT_kwDORICdSM5u9vlz** - guard undefined req.body (line 229 in guilds.js)\n   - The POST /actions endpoint doesn't guard against undefined req.body.\n\n10. **PRRT_kwDORICdSM5u9vl5** - NaN port handling (line 75 in server.js)\n    - The code handles NaN: `const port = Number.isNaN(parsed) ? 3001 : parsed;`\n\n11. **PRRT_kwDORICdSM5u9vl6** - server reference on close error (line 111 in server.js)\n    - In stopServer, `server = null` is set before checking error, which means if there's an error, the reference is lost.\n\n12. **PRRT_kwDORICdSM5u9vmE** - formatter diff (line 67 in health.test.js)\n    - Some formatting issue.\n\nLet me fetch the actual PR comments to understand what the reviewer wants.

Express 5 also no longer initializes `req.body` to `{}` by default, so missing parsing is more obvious. [1]\\n\\n### Most common causes (and fixes)\\n\\n1) **Missing / wrong `Content-Type`**\\n- `express.json()` only parses when the request `Content-Type` matches JSON (typically `application/json`). If the header is missing (or is something else), it will skip parsing and `req.body` can be `undefined`. [2][3]  \\n**Fix (client):**\\n```http\\nContent-Type: application/json\\n```\\nand send a JSON string body.\\n\\n2) **Middleware not installed or added after routes**\\n- If you don’t register a parser (or you register it after your routes), `req.body` won’t be populated. [2]  \\n**Fix (server, before routes):**\\n```js\\nimport express from \\\"express\\\";\\nconst app = express();\\n\\napp.use(express.json());                 // for application/json\\napp.use(express.urlencoded({ extended:false })); // for form posts\\n\\napp.post(\\\"/api\\\", (req, res) => res.json({ body: req.body }));\\n```\\n\\n3) **You’re sending a different body type**\\n- Use the matching parser (`express.text()`, `express.raw()`, `express.urlencoded()`) or configure the parser’s `type` option if you’re using a custom content-type. [2][3]\\n\\n---\\n\\n🌐 Web query:\\n\\n`Express 5 how does express.json handle requests without application/json content-type`\\n\\n💡 Result:\\n\\nIn **Express 5**, `express.json()` will **only parse the body when the request’s `Content-Type` matches its `type` option** (which **defaults to `application/json`**). If the request has **no `Content-Type` header** or it’s **not JSON**, the middleware **skips parsing** and your handler will see **no parsed JSON in `req.body`**. [1]\\n\\nIf you need to parse JSON sent with a different (or missing) `Content-Type`, change the matcher, e.g.:\\n\\n```js\\napp.use(express.json({ type: ['application/json', 'application/*+json'] }))\\n```\\n\\n(or a custom `type: (req) => true`, though that’s usually not recommended).

If the client sends a valid JSON *primitive* (e.g. `\\\"hi\\\"`, `true`, `123`, `null`), it will be rejected (typically 400 “invalid json”). Setting **`strict: false`** allows any value that `JSON.parse` accepts.

Express 5 also no longer initializes `req.body` to `{}` by default, so missing parsing is more obvious. [1]\\n\\n### Most common causes (and fixes)\\n\\n1) **Missing / wrong `Content-Type`**\\n- `express.json()` only parses when the request `Content-Type` matches JSON (typically `application/json`). If the header is missing (or is something else), it will skip parsing and `req.body` can be `undefined`. [2][3]  \\n**Fix (client):**\\n```http\\nContent-Type: application/json\\n```\\nand send a JSON string body.\\n\\n2) **Middleware not installed or added after routes**\\n- If you don’t register a parser (or you register it after your routes), `req.body` won’t be populated. [2]  \\n**Fix (server, before routes):**\\n```js\\nimport express from \\\"express\\\";\\nconst app = express();\\n\\napp.use(express.json());                 // for application/json\\napp.use(express.urlencoded({ extended:false })); // for form posts\\n\\napp.post(\\\"/api\\\", (req, res) => res.json({ body: req.body }));\\n```\\n\\n3) **You’re sending a different body type**\\n- Use the matching parser (`express.text()`, `express.raw()`, `express.urlencoded()`) or configure the parser’s `type` option if you’re using a custom content-type. [2][3]\\n\\n---\\n\\n🌐 Web query:\\n\\n`Express 5 how does express.json handle requests without application/json content-type`\\n\\n💡 Result:\\n\\nIn **Express 5**, `express.json()` will **only parse the body when the request’s `Content-Type` matches its `type` option** (which **defaults to `application/json`**). If the request has **no `Content-Type` header** or it’s **not JSON**, the middleware **skips parsing** and your handler will see **no parsed JSON in `req.body`**. [1]\\n\\nIf you need to parse JSON sent with a different (or missing) `Content-Type`, change the matcher, e.g.:\\n\\n```js\\napp.use(express.json({ type: ['application/json', 'application/*+json'] }))\\n```\\n\\n(or a custom `type: (req) => true`, though that’s usually not recommended).

If the client sends a valid JSON *primitive* (e.g. `\\\"hi\\\"`, `true`, `123`, `null`), it will be rejected (typically 400 “invalid json”). Setting **`strict: false`** allows any value that `JSON.parse` accepts. [1]\\n\\n```js\\napp.use(express.json({ strict: false })); // allow \\\"string\\\", 123, true, null, etc.\\n```\\n\\n### 2) `req.body` can be `undefined` in Express 5\\nIn Express 5, `req.body` is **not guaranteed to be `{}`**. If the body **has not been parsed** (or no body was sent), `req.body` can be **`undefined`**. This is explicitly called out in the Express 5 migration guide. [2]\\n\\nSo defensive handling is now common:\\n\\n```js\\napp.post(\\\"/endpoint\\\", (req, res) => {\\n  const body = req.body ?? {};   // normalize empty/missing body\\n  res.json({ body });\\n});\\n```\\n\\n**Sources:**  \\n[1] Express body-parser JSON `strict` option docs (defaults and behavior) ([expressjs.com](https://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/body-parser?utm_source=openai))  \\n[2] Express “Migrating to Express 5” – `req.body` behavior change ([expressjs.com](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/migrating-5.html?utm_source=openai))\\n\\nCitations:\\n\\n- 1: https://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/body-parser?utm_source=openai\\n- 2: https://expressjs.com/en/guide/migrating-5.html?utm_source=openai\\n\\n---\\n\\n🏁 Script executed:\\n\\n```shell\\ncd /dev/shm && find . -name \\\"guilds.js\\\" -path \\\"*/api/routes/*\\\" | head -1\\n```\\n\\nRepository: BillChirico/bills-bot\\n\\nLength of output: 123\\n\\n---\\n\\n🏁 Script executed:\\n\\n```shell\\ncat -n src/api/routes/guilds.js | sed -n '90,110p; 225,235p'\\n```\\n\\nRepository: BillChirico/bills-bot\\n\\nLength of output: 1399\\n\\n---\\n\\n🏁 Script executed:\\n\\n```shell\\ncat -n src/server.js | sed -n '50,60p'\\n```\\n\\nRepository: BillChirico/bills-bot\\n\\nLength of output: 110\\n\\n---\\n\\n🏁 Script executed:\\n\\n```shell\\nfind . -name \\\"server.js\\\" -type f\\n```\\n\\nRepository: BillChirico/bills-bot\\n\\nLength of output: 84\\n\\n---\\n\\n🏁 Script executed:\\n\\n```shell\\ncat -n src/api/routes/guilds.js | sed -n '1,15p'\\n```\\n\\nRepository: BillChirico/bills-bot\\n\\nLength of output: 622\\n\\n---\\n\\n🏁 Script executed:\\n\\n```shell\\ncat -n src/api/server.js | grep -A 20 \\\"error\\\\|catch\\\" | head -40\\n```\\n\\nRepository: BillChirico/bills-bot\\n\\nLength of output: 1611\\n\\n---\\n\\n🏁 Script executed:\\n\\n```shell\\ncat -n src/api/server.js | tail -30\\n```\\n\\nRepository: BillChirico/bills-bot\\n\\nLength of output: 884\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n\\n</details>\\n\\n**Guard against `undefined` `req.body` before destructuring in Express 5.**\\n\\nIn Express 5, `req.body` remains `undefined` when a request lacks a `Content-Type: application/json` header or the header is missing.

Public response should only include `{ status: \"ok\", uptime }`.\n\n### Issue 2: src/api/routes/health.js:37\nTiming-safe secret comparison logic is duplicated between health.js and auth.js. Extract a shared helper `isValidSecret(secret)` that does the constant-time comparison, export it from auth.js, and use it in both files.\n\n## GROUP 2: Correctness (commit: \"fix: scope conversations stats and harden server lifecycle\")\n\n### Issue 3: src/api/routes/guilds.js:133\nConversations count query returns global total, not guild-scoped. Filter by guild channel IDs:\n```js\ndbPool.query(\n  'SELECT COUNT(*)::int AS count FROM conversations WHERE channel_id = ANY($1::text[])',\n  [Array.from(req.guild.channels.cache.keys())]\n)\n```\n\n### Issue 4: src/api/server.js:75\nNaN port when BOT_API_PORT is non-numeric. Fix:\n```js\nconst portEnv = process.env.BOT_API_PORT;\nconst parsed = portEnv != null ? Number.parseInt(portEnv, 10) : NaN;\nconst port = Number.isNaN(parsed) ? 3001 : parsed;\n```\n\n### Issue 5: src/api/server.js:111\nServer reference not nulled on close error. Move `server = null` before the error check:\n```js\nserver.close((err) => {\n  server = null;\n  if (err) {\n    error('Error closing API server', { error: err.message });\n    reject(err);\n  } else {\n    info('API server stopped');\n    resolve();\n  }\n});\n```\n\n### Issue 6: src/api/routes/guilds.js:229\nGuard against undefined req.body in POST /:id/actions route (Express 5 does not guarantee req.body is defined). Add:\n```js\nif (!req.body) {\n  return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Request body is required' });\n}\n```\nAlso apply same guard to PATCH /:id/config route around line 96.\n\n## GROUP 3: Nitpicks (commit: \"chore: address PR review nitpicks\")\n\n### Issue 7: src/api/server.js:36\nCORS includes DELETE but no DELETE routes exist. Change to:\n```js\nres.set(\"Access-Control-Allow-Methods\", \"GET, POST, PATCH, OPTIONS\");\n```\n\n### Issue 8: src/api/routes/guilds.js:260\nResponse echoes original content, not sanitized content from safeSend. Use:\n```js\nconst sent = Array.isArray(message) ? message[0] : message;\nres.status(201).json({ id: sent.id, channelId, content: sent.content });\n```\n\n### Issue 9: tests/api/routes/health.test.js:15\nMove vi.unstubAllEnvs() into afterEach block to prevent env leaks:\n```js\nafterEach(() => {\n  vi.unstubAllEnvs();\n  vi.clearAllMocks();\n});\n```\nRemove manual vi.unstubAllEnvs() calls at lines 53 and 66.\n\n### Issue 10: tests/api/routes/health.test.js:67\nRun formatter on the file (pnpm biome format --write tests/api/routes/health.test.js).\n\n### Issue 11: src/api/routes/guilds.js:18\nRemove \"logging\" from SAFE_CONFIG_KEYS to prevent API callers from modifying logging transport settings.\n\n### Issue 12: src/api/routes/guilds.js:240-243\nContent length validation blocks safeSend splitting. Remove the 2000-char validation check and let safeSend handle splitting automatically.\n\n## After fixes:\n1. Run tests: pnpm test\n2. Run formatter: pnpm biome format --write .\n3. Run lint: pnpm biome check --apply .\n4. Git add and commit per group\n\nDo NOT push - I will handle that after verification.\n"}}],"api":"openai-completions","provider":"zai","model":"glm-5","usage":{"input":1097,"output":937,"cacheRead":45632,"cacheWrite":0,"totalTokens":47666,"cost":{"input":0,"output":0,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0,"total":0}},"stopReason":"toolUse","timestamp":1771308101967}}
