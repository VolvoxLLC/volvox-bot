Follow it exactly.\n> **If you're Pip Build main session:** This documents what sub-agents must do.\n\n## 1. Codesession Tracking (MANDATORY — DO NOT SKIP)\n\nTrack the ENTIRE session — no exceptions. Always use `--json` on every `cs` command.\n**If you skip any of these steps, the session is incomplete and Bill will notice.**\n\n### How It Works (v2.1.0+)\n\nCodesession resolves sessions by **CWD / git root**. As long as each sub-agent runs from its own worktree, parallel sessions just work — no `--session <id>` needed. All commands (`start`, `log-ai`, `note`, `status`, `end`) auto-resolve to the correct session based on your working directory.\n\n### Step-by-step (EVERY sub-agent session):\n\n**FIRST THING — start session FROM THE WORKTREE DIRECTORY:**\n\n```bash\ncd /tmp/bills-bot-<branch>   # MUST be in worktree dir so cs tracks the right git root\ncs start \"task description\" --json\n```\n\n⚠️ If you run `cs start` from the wrong directory, file changes and commits won't be tracked.\n⚠️ `cs start` only blocks if there's already an active session for the same directory/git root.\n\n**After EVERY Claude Code invocation**, log the AI call:\n\n```bash\ncs log-ai -p anthropic -m claude-opus-4-6 --prompt-tokens <n> --completion-tokens <n> --json\n```\n\n⚠️ **THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT STEP.** If you skip `cs log-ai`, the session shows 0 tokens and 0 cost — making it look like nothing happened. Extract token counts from Claude Code output. If you can't get exact numbers, estimate. **NEVER skip this.**\n\n**At every meaningful step** (starting work, reading code, found an issue, making changes, tests passing, pushing, etc.):\n\n```bash\ncs note \"detailed description of what you're doing and why\" --json\n```\n\n**Be verbose** — don't write \"working on memory module\", write \"adding opt-out toggle to /memory command — storing state in Set + JSON persistence, wiring into extractAndStoreMemories skip logic\". Minimum 3-5 notes per session. We need full visibility.\n\n**Before expensive operations** (large refactors, multiple Claude Code calls):\n\n```bash\ncs status --json   # check aiCost field, warn if > $5\n```\n\n**LAST THING you do (after all work is done, pushed, threads resolved):**\n\n```bash\ncs end -n \"detailed summary: files changed, tests added/modified, coverage numbers, commit SHAs, what was done\" --json\n```\n\n### Checklist — verify you did ALL of these:\n\n- [ ] `cd` into worktree BEFORE `cs start`\n- [ ] `cs start` at the very beginning\n- [ ] Stay in the worktree dir for ALL `cs` commands (auto-resolves to correct session)\n- [ ] `cs log-ai` after EVERY AI/Claude Code call (non-negotiable — 0 tokens = broken session)\n- [ ] `cs note` with detailed descriptions at meaningful steps (minimum 3-5 per session)\n- [ ] `cs status` before expensive ops\n- [ ] `cs end` with detailed summary at the very end\n- [ ] Final check: `cs status --json` — verify aiTokens > 0 and filesChanged > 0\n\nRead `skills/codesession/SKILL.md` for full details.\n\n## 2. Claude Code (MANDATORY — NON-NEGOTIABLE)\n\nUse `claude` CLI for ALL programming work. Do NOT hand-write code patches using edit/write tools.\n**ALWAYS use `--model opus`** — Claude Code defaults to Sonnet without it. Opus is required, no exceptions.\n\n```bash\nexec pty:true workdir:<project-dir> command:\"claude --model opus --effort high --dangerously-skip-permissions '<task description>'\"\n```\n\n- **`--model opus --effort high --dangerously-skip-permissions` is REQUIRED on every `claude` invocation** — this is non-negotiable\n- Monitor with `process:log`, don't hand-code patches\n- Agent Teams enabled (`~/.claude/settings.json`) — use for parallel work\n- After Claude Code finishes, log token usage with `cs log-ai`\n- If you write code directly with edit/write tools instead of using `claude` CLI, the session is invalid\n\n## 3. Git Workflow\n\n- **Git worktrees MANDATORY** — NEVER checkout branches in the main repo directory. Always create a worktree:\n  ```bash\n  cd /home/bill/.openclaw/workspace-build/bills-bot\n  git worktree add /tmp/bills-bot-<branch-name> -b <branch-name>\n  cd /tmp/bills-bot-<branch-name>\n  # Do all work here. Clean up when done:\n  git worktree remove /tmp/bills-bot-<branch-name>\n  ```\n  This keeps parallel sub-agents isolated. NON-NEGOTIABLE.\n- **Feature branches only** — never commit directly to main\n- **Conventional commits** — `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`\n- **PRs mandatory** for shared repos\n- **One commit per review comment** on PR review tasks\n- **Check for outdated packages** before every PR (`pnpm outdated`)\n- **80% test coverage mandatory** — statements, branches, functions, lines\n- **Always fix nitpick comments** — unless they don't make sense, would break things, or are redundant\n\n## 4. Board Comments (when task has a board ID)\n\n```bash\n# Start timer BEFORE working:\nvk begin <taskId>\n\n# Comment at EVERY meaningful step (not just start/end):\nvk comment <taskId> \"Starting work — reading codebase\" --author \"Pip Code\"\nvk comment <taskId> \"Found issue in X — applying fix\" --author \"Pip Code\"\nvk comment <taskId> \"Tests passing, committing\" --author \"Pip Code\"\n\n# When done:\nvk done <taskId> \"summary of work\" --author \"Pip Code\"\n```\n\nDo NOT mark a task done until ALL `verificationSteps` are met.\n\n- While executing a board task, keep **subtasks** updated in real time (mark completed ones as checked/done).\n- Keep **done criteria / verificationSteps** updated in real time (check each item as it is verified).\n- Final `vk done` only after subtasks and verificationSteps are accurately checked off.\n- **End-of-task requirement:** before closing, explicitly verify every done-criteria item is both (a) actually completed in the work and (b) marked completed in the board.\n- **Merge Conflict Check:** before finishing, check for merge conflicts with the target branch and fix them if they exist.\n\n## 5. PR Review Thread Resolution\n\nAfter fixing each review comment, resolve the thread on GitHub:\n\n```bash\ngh api graphql -f query='mutation { resolveReviewThread(input: {threadId: \"THREAD_ID\"}) { thread { isResolved } } }'\n```\n\n**⚠️ PAGINATION IS MANDATORY when fetching threads.** GitHub GraphQL `reviewThreads(first:100)` returns max 100 per page. If a PR has 100+ threads, you MUST paginate using `pageInfo{hasNextPage endCursor}` and loop with `after:` cursor. We once missed 22 threads because we only fetched page 1. Use this pattern:\n\n```bash\n# Fetch ALL unresolved threads across all pages\nCURSOR=\"\"\nwhile true; do\n  if [ -z \"$CURSOR\" ]; then\n    QUERY=\"reviewThreads(first:100)\"\n  else\n    QUERY=\"reviewThreads(first:100,after:\\\"$CURSOR\\\")\"\n  fi\n  # ... fetch, collect unresolved threads, check hasNextPage, update CURSOR\n  # Break when hasNextPage is false\ndone\n```\n\nDo **not** post a summary comment on the GitHub PR unless Bill explicitly asks.\n\nInstead, report completion details back to the parent agent (what was fixed, commits, tests, thread resolution), and let the parent agent report to Bill.\n\n- **Merge Conflict Check:** before finishing, check for merge conflicts with the target branch and fix them if they exist.\n\nThis does **not** change board behavior: for board-linked tasks, continue posting verbose board comments (`vk comment ... --author \"Pip Code\"`) and keeping subtasks/done-criteria updated.\n\n## 6. Testing\n\n- Run `pnpm test` — all tests must pass\n- Coverage must stay above 80% on all metrics\n- New code must include tests\n- Use `vitest` — project is already configured\n\n## 7. Code Standards\n\n- **Winston logger only** — NEVER use `console.*` in src/ files (Biome `noConsole: error`)\n- **Keep docs up to date** — README.md, AGENTS.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, .env.example\n- **bills-bot stack:** Node.js ESM, discord.js v14, pnpm, Biome, vitest\n\n## Key Paths\n\n- **bills-bot repo:** `/home/bill/.openclaw/workspace-build/bills-bot/`\n- **Board API:** `http://localhost:3001`\n- **Board CLI:** `vk <command>`\n"}],"isError":false,"timestamp":1771303124700}}

The test assertion `mockChannel.send` should be updated to expect the sanitized call pattern.\n- Add test for content length > 2000 returning 400\nCommit message: fix: use safeSend for mention sanitization and add content length validation\n\n## Fix Group 3: Config not guild-scoped + sensitive data filtering\nFile: src/api/routes/guilds.js\n- GET /:id/config: Filter out sensitive keys from config before returning. Create a SENSITIVE_PATHS set containing paths like \"database\", \"db\", \"token\", \"secret\", \"apiKey\", \"api_key\", \"password\", \"connectionString\". Use a helper function that deep-clones config and removes any keys matching sensitive patterns.\n- PATCH /:id/config: Add a comment acknowledging config is global (not per-guild) since bills-bot uses a single global config. Log a note that guild ID is informational only. This is acceptable because the bot is single-guild focused, but the comment should acknowledge the limitation.\nCommit message: fix: filter sensitive data from config endpoint response\n\n## Fix Group 4: Stats conversations query not guild-scoped\nFile: src/api/routes/guilds.js  \n- In GET /:id/stats: The conversations table has a guild_id column. Add WHERE guild_id = $1 to the conversations COUNT query, passing req.params.id as parameter.\nFile: tests/api/routes/guilds.test.js\n- Update the stats test to verify the conversations query includes guild_id parameter\nCommit message: fix: scope conversations count query to guild\n\n## Fix Group 5: Members pagination non-functional\nFile: src/api/routes/guilds.js\n- In GET /:id/members: Discord.js guild.members.fetch() only supports `limit` and `after` (snowflake cursor), NOT offset-based pagination.\n- Change approach: use cursor-based pagination. Accept `after` query param (member ID snowflake) instead of `page`.\n- Pass { limit, after } to guild.members.fetch() if after is provided\n- Return `after` cursor (last member ID) in response for next page\n- Remove `page` from response, add `nextCursor` (last member ID or null if fewer results than limit)\nFile: tests/api/routes/guilds.test.js\n- Update member tests to reflect cursor-based pagination (remove page references, add after/nextCursor)\nCommit message: fix: implement cursor-based pagination for members endpoint\n\n## Fix Group 6: User input reflected in error response\nFile: src/api/routes/guilds.js\n- In POST /:id/actions else branch: Change `Unknown action: ${action}` to just `Unknown action` (dont reflect user input)\nFile: tests/api/routes/guilds.test.js\n- Update \"should return 400 for unknown action\" test to check for \"Unknown action\" without the reflected value\nCommit message: fix: avoid reflecting user input in error responses\n\n## Fix Group 7: CORS/OPTIONS behavior when unconfigured\nFile: src/api/server.js\n- When DASHBOARD_URL is not set, log a warning about CORS not being configured\n- Do NOT set CORS headers when DASHBOARD_URL is unset\n- Still handle OPTIONS but return 204 only when CORS is configured; otherwise let it fall through (or return 404)\nFile: tests/api/server.test.js\n- Add test: OPTIONS without DASHBOARD_URL should not return CORS headers\nCommit message: fix: warn and restrict CORS when DASHBOARD_URL is unset\n\n## Fix Group 8: Server module-level mutable state\nFile: src/api/server.js\n- startServer should check if server is already running and either throw or stop the old one first\n- Add guard: if (server?.listening) throw new Error(\"API server already running\") or close old server first\n- Make stopServer set server = null after closing\n- Actually stopServer already sets server = null. Just add the guard in startServer.\nFile: tests/api/server.test.js\n- Add test: calling startServer twice should handle it gracefully\n- Remove redundant vi.unstubAllEnvs() calls that are already in afterEach\nCommit message: fix: prevent server leak on duplicate startServer calls\n\n## Fix Group 9: Rate limiter cleanup interval leak\nFile: src/api/middleware/rateLimit.js\n- Return an object or attach a `destroy()` method to the middleware function that clears the interval\n- e.g., `middleware.destroy = () => clearInterval(cleanup);`\n- This lets tests clean up properly\nFile: tests/api/middleware/rateLimit.test.js\n- Move vi.useRealTimers() into afterEach to ensure cleanup even on test failure\n- Call middleware.destroy?.() in afterEach if the middleware has it\nCommit message: fix: expose rate limiter destroy method and improve test cleanup\n\n## Fix Group 10: Health endpoint exposes memory info\nFile: src/api/routes/health.js\n- Remove process.memoryUsage() from the unauthenticated health endpoint\n- Keep status, uptime, and discord info (those are fine for health checks)\nFile: tests/api/routes/health.test.js\n- Remove memory assertions from health test\nCommit message: fix: remove memory usage from unauthenticated health endpoint\n\n## Fix Group 11: API server failure resilience\nFile: src/index.js\n- Wrap the `await startServer(client, dbPool)` call in try/catch\n- On failure, log an error but dont crash the bot (warn that API server failed to start)\n- Import warn from logger if not already imported\nCommit message: fix: handle API server startup failure gracefully\n\n## Fix Group 12: Test cleanup nitpicks\nFile: tests/api/server.test.js\n- Remove redundant vi.unstubAllEnvs() calls inside individual tests (already handled in afterEach block)\n(This may already be handled in Fix Group 8 — if so, combine)\n\nAfter ALL fixes, run: pnpm test\nEnsure all tests pass and coverage stays above 80%.\n' 2>&1","timeout":600,"pty":true}}],"api":"anthropic-messages","provider":"anthropic","model":"claude-opus-4-6","usage":{"input":1,"output":1940,"cacheRead":33522,"cacheWrite":276,"totalTokens":35739,"cost":{"input":0.000005,"output":0.0485,"cacheRead":0.016760999999999998,"cacheWrite":0.0017250000000000002,"total":0.066991}},"stopReason":"toolUse","timestamp":1771303168768}}

The test assertion `mockChannel.send` should be updated to expect the sanitized call pattern.\n- Add test for content length > 2000 returning 400\nCommit message: fix: use safeSend for mention sanitization and add content length validation\n\n## Fix Group 3: Config not guild-scoped + sensitive data filtering\nFile: src/api/routes/guilds.js\n- GET /:id/config: Filter out sensitive keys from config before returning. Create a SENSITIVE_PATHS set containing paths like \"database\", \"db\", \"token\", \"secret\", \"apiKey\", \"api_key\", \"password\", \"connectionString\". Use a helper function that deep-clones config and removes any keys matching sensitive patterns.\n- PATCH /:id/config: Add a comment acknowledging config is global (not per-guild) since bills-bot uses a single global config. Log a note that guild ID is informational only. This is acceptable because the bot is single-guild focused, but the comment should acknowledge the limitation.\nCommit message: fix: filter sensitive data from config endpoint response\n\n## Fix Group 4: Stats conversations query not guild-scoped\nFile: src/api/routes/guilds.js  \n- In GET /:id/stats: The conversations table has a guild_id column. Add WHERE guild_id = $1 to the conversations COUNT query, passing req.params.id as parameter.\nFile: tests/api/routes/guilds.test.js\n- Update the stats test to verify the conversations query includes guild_id parameter\nCommit message: fix: scope conversations count query to guild\n\n## Fix Group 5: Members pagination non-functional\nFile: src/api/routes/guilds.js\n- In GET /:id/members: Discord.js guild.members.fetch() only supports `limit` and `after` (snowflake cursor), NOT offset-based pagination.\n- Change approach: use cursor-based pagination. Accept `after` query param (member ID snowflake) instead of `page`.\n- Pass { limit, after } to guild.members.fetch() if after is provided\n- Return `after` cursor (last member ID) in response for next page\n- Remove `page` from response, add `nextCursor` (last member ID or null if fewer results than limit)\nFile: tests/api/routes/guilds.test.js\n- Update member tests to reflect cursor-based pagination (remove page references, add after/nextCursor)\nCommit message: fix: implement cursor-based pagination for members endpoint\n\n## Fix Group 6: User input reflected in error response\nFile: src/api/routes/guilds.js\n- In POST /:id/actions else branch: Change `Unknown action: ${action}` to just `Unknown action` (dont reflect user input)\nFile: tests/api/routes/guilds.test.js\n- Update \"should return 400 for unknown action\" test to check for \"Unknown action\" without the reflected value\nCommit message: fix: avoid reflecting user input in error responses\n\n## Fix Group 7: CORS/OPTIONS behavior when unconfigured\nFile: src/api/server.js\n- When DASHBOARD_URL is not set, log a warning about CORS not being configured\n- Do NOT set CORS headers when DASHBOARD_URL is unset\n- Still handle OPTIONS but return 204 only when CORS is configured; otherwise let it fall through (or return 404)\nFile: tests/api/server.test.js\n- Add test: OPTIONS without DASHBOARD_URL should not return CORS headers\nCommit message: fix: warn and restrict CORS when DASHBOARD_URL is unset\n\n## Fix Group 8: Server module-level mutable state\nFile: src/api/server.js\n- startServer should check if server is already running and either throw or stop the old one first\n- Add guard: if (server?.listening) throw new Error(\"API server already running\") or close old server first\n- Make stopServer set server = null after closing\n- Actually stopServer already sets server = null. Just add the guard in startServer.\nFile: tests/api/server.test.js\n- Add test: calling startServer twice should handle it gracefully\n- Remove redundant vi.unstubAllEnvs() calls that are already in afterEach\nCommit message: fix: prevent server leak on duplicate startServer calls\n\n## Fix Group 9: Rate limiter cleanup interval leak\nFile: src/api/middleware/rateLimit.js\n- Return an object or attach a `destroy()` method to the middleware function that clears the interval\n- e.g., `middleware.destroy = () => clearInterval(cleanup);`\n- This lets tests clean up properly\nFile: tests/api/middleware/rateLimit.test.js\n- Move vi.useRealTimers() into afterEach to ensure cleanup even on test failure\n- Call middleware.destroy?.() in afterEach if the middleware has it\nCommit message: fix: expose rate limiter destroy method and improve test cleanup\n\n## Fix Group 10: Health endpoint exposes memory info\nFile: src/api/routes/health.js\n- Remove process.memoryUsage() from the unauthenticated health endpoint\n- Keep status, uptime, and discord info (those are fine for health checks)\nFile: tests/api/routes/health.test.js\n- Remove memory assertions from health test\nCommit message: fix: remove memory usage from unauthenticated health endpoint\n\n## Fix Group 11: API server failure resilience\nFile: src/index.js\n- Wrap the `await startServer(client, dbPool)` call in try/catch\n- On failure, log an error but dont crash the bot (warn that API server failed to start)\n- Import warn from logger if not already imported\nCommit message: fix: handle API server startup failure gracefully\n\n## Fix Group 12: Test cleanup nitpicks\nFile: tests/api/server.test.js\n- Remove redundant vi.unstubAllEnvs() calls inside individual tests (already handled in afterEach block)\n(This may already be handled in Fix Group 8 — if so, combine)\n\nAfter ALL fixes, run: pnpm test\nEnsure all tests pass and coverage stays above 80%.\n' 2>&1","name":"cd

The test assertion `mockChannel.send` should be updated to expect the sanitized call pattern.\n- Add test for content length > 2000 returning 400\nCommit message: fix: use safeSend for mention sanitization and add content length validation\n\n## Fix Group 3: Config not guild-scoped + sensitive data filtering\nFile: src/api/routes/guilds.js\n- GET /:id/config: Filter out sensitive keys from config before returning. Create a SENSITIVE_PATHS set containing paths like \"database\", \"db\", \"token\", \"secret\", \"apiKey\", \"api_key\", \"password\", \"connectionString\". Use a helper function that deep-clones config and removes any keys matching sensitive patterns.\n- PATCH /:id/config: Add a comment acknowledging config is global (not per-guild) since bills-bot uses a single global config. Log a note that guild ID is informational only. This is acceptable because the bot is single-guild focused, but the comment should acknowledge the limitation.\nCommit message: fix: filter sensitive data from config endpoint response\n\n## Fix Group 4: Stats conversations query not guild-scoped\nFile: src/api/routes/guilds.js  \n- In GET /:id/stats: The conversations table has a guild_id column. Add WHERE guild_id = $1 to the conversations COUNT query, passing req.params.id as parameter.\nFile: tests/api/routes/guilds.test.js\n- Update the stats test to verify the conversations query includes guild_id parameter\nCommit message: fix: scope conversations count query to guild\n\n## Fix Group 5: Members pagination non-functional\nFile: src/api/routes/guilds.js\n- In GET /:id/members: Discord.js guild.members.fetch() only supports `limit` and `after` (snowflake cursor), NOT offset-based pagination.\n- Change approach: use cursor-based pagination. Accept `after` query param (member ID snowflake) instead of `page`.\n- Pass { limit, after } to guild.members.fetch() if after is provided\n- Return `after` cursor (last member ID) in response for next page\n- Remove `page` from response, add `nextCursor` (last member ID or null if fewer results than limit)\nFile: tests/api/routes/guilds.test.js\n- Update member tests to reflect cursor-based pagination (remove page references, add after/nextCursor)\nCommit message: fix: implement cursor-based pagination for members endpoint\n\n## Fix Group 6: User input reflected in error response\nFile: src/api/routes/guilds.js\n- In POST /:id/actions else branch: Change `Unknown action: ${action}` to just `Unknown action` (dont reflect user input)\nFile: tests/api/routes/guilds.test.js\n- Update \"should return 400 for unknown action\" test to check for \"Unknown action\" without the reflected value\nCommit message: fix: avoid reflecting user input in error responses\n\n## Fix Group 7: CORS/OPTIONS behavior when unconfigured\nFile: src/api/server.js\n- When DASHBOARD_URL is not set, log a warning about CORS not being configured\n- Do NOT set CORS headers when DASHBOARD_URL is unset\n- Still handle OPTIONS but return 204 only when CORS is configured; otherwise let it fall through (or return 404)\nFile: tests/api/server.test.js\n- Add test: OPTIONS without DASHBOARD_URL should not return CORS headers\nCommit message: fix: warn and restrict CORS when DASHBOARD_URL is unset\n\n## Fix Group 8: Server module-level mutable state\nFile: src/api/server.js\n- startServer should check if server is already running and either throw or stop the old one first\n- Add guard: if (server?.listening) throw new Error(\"API server already running\") or close old server first\n- Make stopServer set server = null after closing\n- Actually stopServer already sets server = null. Just add the guard in startServer.\nFile: tests/api/server.test.js\n- Add test: calling startServer twice should handle it gracefully\n- Remove redundant vi.unstubAllEnvs() calls that are already in afterEach\nCommit message: fix: prevent server leak on duplicate startServer calls\n\n## Fix Group 9: Rate limiter cleanup interval leak\nFile: src/api/middleware/rateLimit.js\n- Return an object or attach a `destroy()` method to the middleware function that clears the interval\n- e.g., `middleware.destroy = () => clearInterval(cleanup);`\n- This lets tests clean up properly\nFile: tests/api/middleware/rateLimit.test.js\n- Move vi.useRealTimers() into afterEach to ensure cleanup even on test failure\n- Call middleware.destroy?.() in afterEach if the middleware has it\nCommit message: fix: expose rate limiter destroy method and improve test cleanup\n\n## Fix Group 10: Health endpoint exposes memory info\nFile: src/api/routes/health.js\n- Remove process.memoryUsage() from the unauthenticated health endpoint\n- Keep status, uptime, and discord info (those are fine for health checks)\nFile: tests/api/routes/health.test.js\n- Remove memory assertions from health test\nCommit message: fix: remove memory usage from unauthenticated health endpoint\n\n## Fix Group 11: API server failure resilience\nFile: src/index.js\n- Wrap the `await startServer(client, dbPool)` call in try/catch\n- On failure, log an error but dont crash the bot (warn that API server failed to start)\n- Import warn from logger if not already imported\nCommit message: fix: handle API server startup failure gracefully\n\n## Fix Group 12: Test cleanup nitpicks\nFile: tests/api/server.test.js\n- Remove redundant vi.unstubAllEnvs() calls inside individual tests (already handled in afterEach block)\n(This may already be handled in Fix Group 8 — if so, combine)\n\nAfter ALL fixes, run: pnpm test\nEnsure all tests pass and coverage stays above 80%.\n' 2>&1","name":"cd

Fix ALL of them. One commit per logical fix group (e.g. all timing-safe comparison fixes can be one commit, all mention sanitization fixes can be one commit, etc.). Resolve each thread via GraphQL after fixing.\n\nDo NOT post a PR summary comment unless Bill explicitly asks.\n\nUNRESOLVED THREADS:\n\n1. Thread PRRT_kwDORICdSM5u9e52 — src/api/routes/guilds.js:222 (claude) — CRITICAL: channel.send(content) bypasses mention sanitization. Must use safeSend() from src/utils/safeSend.js.\n\n2. Thread PRRT_kwDORICdSM5u9e71 — src/api/routes/guilds.js:209 (claude) — No content length validation. Discord 2000-char limit. Validate upfront or use safeSend().\n\n3. Thread PRRT_kwDORICdSM5u9e9k — src/api/routes/guilds.js:96 (claude) — Config endpoint is not guild-scoped. PATCH /:id/config modifies global config regardless of guild ID.\n\n4. Thread PRRT_kwDORICdSM5u9e-Q — src/api/routes/guilds.js:157 (cursor) — Members endpoint pagination is non-functional. page param parsed but never used in fetch.\n\n5. Thread PRRT_kwDORICdSM5u9e-S — src/api/routes/guilds.js:110 (cursor) — Stats query counts conversations across all guilds (no WHERE clause).\n\n6. Thread PRRT_kwDORICdSM5u9e_G — src/api/middleware/auth.js:25 (claude) — Timing-safe comparison should be used for secret comparison. Use crypto.timingSafeEqual.\n\n7. Thread PRRT_kwDORICdSM5u9fBh — src/api/routes/guilds.js:137 (claude) — Pagination offset not used for Discord member fetch. Discord fetch only supports limit, not offset.\n\n8. Thread PRRT_kwDORICdSM5u9fCy — src/api/routes/guilds.js:231 (claude) — Nitpick: User input (action) reflected in error response.\n\n9. Thread PRRT_kwDORICdSM5u9fD2 — src/api/server.js:43 (claude) — Nitpick: CORS allows all origins when DASHBOARD_URL is unset. Consider logging a warning.\n\n10. Thread PRRT_kwDORICdSM5u9fGB — src/api/routes/guilds.js:71 (claude) — Config endpoint returns entire config including sensitive data (DB creds, API keys).\n\n11. Thread PRRT_kwDORICdSM5u9fG8 — src/api/routes/guilds.js:114 (claude) — conversations table query is not guild-scoped. No WHERE guild_id filter.\n\n12. Thread PRRT_kwDORICdSM5u9fJL — src/api/server.js:12 (claude) — Module-level mutable state prevents running multiple servers. Calling startServer twice orphans first server.\n\n13. Thread PRRT_kwDORICdSM5u9fwC — src/api/middleware/auth.js:27 (coderabbitai) — Same as #6: timing-safe comparison needed for secret validation.\n\n14. Thread PRRT_kwDORICdSM5u9fwF — src/api/middleware/rateLimit.js:51 (coderabbitai) — Nitpick: No mechanism to stop the cleanup interval. Potential timer leak in tests.\n\n15. Thread PRRT_kwDORICdSM5u9fwI — src/api/routes/guilds.js:71 (coderabbitai) — Same as #3/#10: Config endpoints return global config, not guild-scoped.\n\n16. Thread PRRT_kwDORICdSM5u9fwJ — src/api/routes/guilds.js:114 (coderabbitai) — Same as #5/#11: conversations count not guild-scoped.\n\n17. Thread PRRT_kwDORICdSM5u9fwM — src/api/routes/guilds.js:137 (coderabbitai) — Same as #4/#7: Pagination page param ineffective for members endpoint.\n\n18. Thread PRRT_kwDORICdSM5u9fwP — src/api/routes/guilds.js:224 (coderabbitai) — Same as #1: Content must be sanitized before sending to Discord. Use sanitizeMentions() + safeSend().\n\n19. Thread PRRT_kwDORICdSM5u9fwS — src/api/routes/guilds.js:231 (coderabbitai) — Same as #8: Avoid reflecting raw user input in error responses.\n\n20. Thread PRRT_kwDORICdSM5u9fwX — src/api/routes/health.js:27 (coderabbitai) — Health endpoint exposes detailed memory info without authentication. process.memoryUsage() leaks internal info.\n\n21. Thread PRRT_kwDORICdSM5u9fwY — src/api/server.js:43 (coderabbitai) — Same as #9: OPTIONS preflight responds 204 even when CORS is not configured.\n\n22. Thread PRRT_kwDORICdSM5u9fwZ — src/api/server.js:82 (coderabbitai) — Same as #12: Calling startServer twice leaks the first server.\n\n23. Thread PRRT_kwDORICdSM5u9fwc — src/index.js:458 (coderabbitai) — Consider resilience if API server fails to start. Don't crash entire bot if API port is busy.\n\n24. Thread PRRT_kwDORICdSM5u9fwd — tests/api/middleware/rateLimit.test.js:87 (coderabbitai) — Nitpick: Fake timers restoration could be missed on test failure. Use afterEach.\n\n25. Thread PRRT_kwDORICdSM5u9fwh — tests/api/server.test.js:59 (coderabbitai) — Nitpick: Remove redundant vi.unstubAllEnvs() calls (already in afterEach).\n\nSUMMARY OF UNIQUE ISSUES (many threads are duplicates across reviewers):\n- Mention sanitization / safeSend (threads 1, 2, 18)\n- Config not guild-scoped (threads 3, 10, 15)\n- Stats conversations not guild-scoped (threads 5, 11, 16)\n- Members pagination non-functional (threads 4, 7, 17)\n- Timing-safe auth comparison (threads 6, 13)\n- User input reflected in error (threads 8, 19)\n- CORS/OPTIONS behavior when unconfigured (threads 9, 21)\n- Server module-level mutable state (threads 12, 22)\n- Rate limiter cleanup interval leak (thread 14)\n- Health endpoint exposes memory info (thread 20)\n- API server failure resilience (thread 23)\n- Test cleanup nitpicks (threads 24, 25)\n\nGroup commits logically.

The test assertion `mockChannel.send` should be updated to expect the sanitized call pattern.\n- Add test for content length > 2000 returning 400\nCommit message: fix: use safeSend for mention sanitization and add content length validation\n\n## Fix Group 3: Config not guild-scoped + sensitive data filtering\nFile: src/api/routes/guilds.js\n- GET /:id/config: Filter out sensitive keys from config before returning. Create a SENSITIVE_PATHS set containing paths like \"database\", \"db\", \"token\", \"secret\", \"apiKey\", \"api_key\", \"password\", \"connectionString\". Use a helper function that deep-clones config and removes any keys matching sensitive patterns.\n- PATCH /:id/config: Add a comment acknowledging config is global (not per-guild) since bills-bot uses a single global config. Log a note that guild ID is informational only. This is acceptable because the bot is single-guild focused, but the comment should acknowledge the limitation.\nCommit message: fix: filter sensitive data from config endpoint response\n\n## Fix Group 4: Stats conversations query not guild-scoped\nFile: src/api/routes/guilds.js  \n- In GET /:id/stats: The conversations table has a guild_id column. Add WHERE guild_id = $1 to the conversations COUNT query, passing req.params.id as parameter.\nFile: tests/api/routes/guilds.test.js\n- Update the stats test to verify the conversations query includes guild_id parameter\nCommit message: fix: scope conversations count query to guild\n\n## Fix Group 5: Members pagination non-functional\nFile: src/api/routes/guilds.js\n- In GET /:id/members: Discord.js guild.members.fetch() only supports `limit` and `after` (snowflake cursor), NOT offset-based pagination.\n- Change approach: use cursor-based pagination. Accept `after` query param (member ID snowflake) instead of `page`.\n- Pass { limit, after } to guild.members.fetch() if after is provided\n- Return `after` cursor (last member ID) in response for next page\n- Remove `page` from response, add `nextCursor` (last member ID or null if fewer results than limit)\nFile: tests/api/routes/guilds.test.js\n- Update member tests to reflect cursor-based pagination (remove page references, add after/nextCursor)\nCommit message: fix: implement cursor-based pagination for members endpoint\n\n## Fix Group 6: User input reflected in error response\nFile: src/api/routes/guilds.js\n- In POST /:id/actions else branch: Change `Unknown action: ${action}` to just `Unknown action` (dont reflect user input)\nFile: tests/api/routes/guilds.test.js\n- Update \"should return 400 for unknown action\" test to check for \"Unknown action\" without the reflected value\nCommit message: fix: avoid reflecting user input in error responses\n\n## Fix Group 7: CORS/OPTIONS behavior when unconfigured\nFile: src/api/server.js\n- When DASHBOARD_URL is not set, log a warning about CORS not being configured\n- Do NOT set CORS headers when DASHBOARD_URL is unset\n- Still handle OPTIONS but return 204 only when CORS is configured; otherwise let it fall through (or return 404)\nFile: tests/api/server.test.js\n- Add test: OPTIONS without DASHBOARD_URL should not return CORS headers\nCommit message: fix: warn and restrict CORS when DASHBOARD_URL is unset\n\n## Fix Group 8: Server module-level mutable state\nFile: src/api/server.js\n- startServer should check if server is already running and either throw or stop the old one first\n- Add guard: if (server?.listening) throw new Error(\"API server already running\") or close old server first\n- Make stopServer set server = null after closing\n- Actually stopServer already sets server = null. Just add the guard in startServer.\nFile: tests/api/server.test.js\n- Add test: calling startServer twice should handle it gracefully\n- Remove redundant vi.unstubAllEnvs() calls that are already in afterEach\nCommit message: fix: prevent server leak on duplicate startServer calls\n\n## Fix Group 9: Rate limiter cleanup interval leak\nFile: src/api/middleware/rateLimit.js\n- Return an object or attach a `destroy()` method to the middleware function that clears the interval\n- e.g., `middleware.destroy = () => clearInterval(cleanup);`\n- This lets tests clean up properly\nFile: tests/api/middleware/rateLimit.test.js\n- Move vi.useRealTimers() into afterEach to ensure cleanup even on test failure\n- Call middleware.destroy?.() in afterEach if the middleware has it\nCommit message: fix: expose rate limiter destroy method and improve test cleanup\n\n## Fix Group 10: Health endpoint exposes memory info\nFile: src/api/routes/health.js\n- Remove process.memoryUsage() from the unauthenticated health endpoint\n- Keep status, uptime, and discord info (those are fine for health checks)\nFile: tests/api/routes/health.test.js\n- Remove memory assertions from health test\nCommit message: fix: remove memory usage from unauthenticated health endpoint\n\n## Fix Group 11: API server failure resilience\nFile: src/index.js\n- Wrap the `await startServer(client, dbPool)` call in try/catch\n- On failure, log an error but dont crash the bot (warn that API server failed to start)\n- Import warn from logger if not already imported\nCommit message: fix: handle API server startup failure gracefully\n\n## Fix Group 12: Test cleanup nitpicks\nFile: tests/api/server.test.js\n- Remove redundant vi.unstubAllEnvs() calls inside individual tests (already handled in afterEach block)\n(This may already be handled in Fix Group 8 — if so, combine)\n\nAfter ALL fixes, run: pnpm test\nEnsure all tests pass and coverage stays above 80%.\n' 2>&1","name":"cd
