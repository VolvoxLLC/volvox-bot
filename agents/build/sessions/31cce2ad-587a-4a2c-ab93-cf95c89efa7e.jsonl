Do NOT check, fix, or address PRs from anyone else (other contributors, bots like coderabbitai, dependabot[bot], renovate[bot]) unless Bill has explicitly told you to.\n\nDo this each run:\n1) List open PRs in BillChirico/bills-bot.\n2) Filter to ONLY Bill's PRs and Pip Build's PRs. Skip everything else.\n3) For eligible PRs, check BOTH:\n   a) Unresolved inline review threads (paginate — max 100/page, use pageInfo cursor).\n   b) Top-level/high-level review comments — fetch all reviews via `gh api repos/BillChirico/bills-bot/pulls/{number}/reviews` and look for CHANGES_REQUESTED or COMMENT reviews whose body contains actionable feedback NOT already addressed by subsequent commits. Compare the review's commit_id against HEAD to see if new commits exist after the review.\n4) If no unresolved threads AND no unaddressed high-level review comments on eligible PRs: respond exactly `NO_REPLY`.\n5) If unresolved threads or unaddressed high-level comments exist:\n   - Spawn ONE sub-agent PER PR (parallel), never batch PRs together.\n   - Use agentId `build`, model `anthropic/claude-opus-4-6`, thinking `high`.\n   - Include full unresolved thread details (thread id, file path, line, issue summary).\n   - Include any unaddressed high-level review comment bodies and their review IDs.\n   - Instruct spawned agents to read and follow CODING.md, fix all review comments (including nitpicks unless nonsensical/breaking/redundant), run tests/coverage, resolve threads.\n   - Instruct spawned agents NOT to post PR summary comments unless Bill explicitly asks.\n   - Have spawned agents report completion summary back to parent agent.\n   - After spawning, send Bill a concise Discord DM status update:\n     - channel: discord\n     - target: user:191633014441115648\n     - accountId: pip-build\n     - include PR numbers, unresolved thread counts, and high-level comment counts.\n6) If any spawned run fails/stalls, note it in DM and respawn once.\n\nKeep updates concise and action-oriented.\nCurrent time: Tuesday, February 17th, 2026 — 7:49 PM (America/New_York)"}],"timestamp":1771375795865}}
