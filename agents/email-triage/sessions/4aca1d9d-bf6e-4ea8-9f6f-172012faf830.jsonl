The implementation is solid overall with proper parameterized queries and graceful failure handling, but there are a few issues to address:\r\n\r\n**🟡 Warnings:**\r\n1. **ILIKE wildcard escape** — `src/utils/logQuery.js:55` doesn't escape `%` and `_` in search terms\r\n2. **Missing documentation** — New files (`src/transports/postgres.js`, `src/utils/logQuery.js`) need to be added to AGENTS.md Key Files table, and `logging.database` config needs README.md documentation\r\n\r\n**🔵 Nitpick:**\r\n1. **Level validation** — Consider validating the `level` parameter against allowed values\r\n\r\nSee inline comments and the formal review for details.\r\n\r\n--\r\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\r\nhttps://github.com/BillChirico/bills-bot/pull/65#issuecomment-3910872068\r\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\r\n\r\nMessage ID: <BillChirico/bills-bot/pull/65/c3910872068@github.com>\n\nINSTRUCTIONS: Evaluate this email.
