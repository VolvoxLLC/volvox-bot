So you start by forking my repo. Just click on the fork button on the top of my repo, and it will create the Thaw repo in your account. You then add this as a remote. When you finished the translation, you just push this into your repo and when you go to your repo on GitHub, it will allow you to open a pull request.\r\n\r\nBut since you already started, you might run into merge conflicts. Just finish your translation and upload the `Localizable.xcstrings` here, and I will commit them for you.\r\n\r\n-- \r\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\r\nhttps://github.com/stonerl/Thaw/discussions/104#discussioncomment-15827366\r\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\r\n\r\nMessage ID: <stonerl/Thaw/repo-discussions/104/comments/15827366@github.com>\n\nINSTRUCTIONS: Evaluate this email.
