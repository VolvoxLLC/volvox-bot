update\r\nthe NEXTAUTH_SECRET entry to a clearly marked value like\r\nCHANGE_ME_generate_with_openssl_rand_base64_32 (or empty) and ensure any startup\r\nvalidation checks will fail fast if the variable still matches the sentinel.\r\nReference: NEXTAUTH_SECRET.\r\n\r\nIn `@web/.env.local.example`:\r\n- Around line 4-9: Add the missing BOT_API_SECRET environment variable to the\r\nexample file so local developers have parity with the companion .env example;\r\nupdate web/.env.local.example by adding a BOT_API_SECRET= placeholder line\r\n(similar to BOT_API_URL=) alongside DISCORD_CLIENT_ID, DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET,\r\nNEXTAUTH_SECRET, NEXTAUTH_URL, BOT_API_URL, and NEXT_PUBLIC_DISCORD_CLIENT_ID to\r\nensure the bot API auth flow can be configured locally.\r\n- Line 6: Replace the hardcoded NEXTAUTH_SECRET default in .env.local.example\r\nwith an empty value and an inline comment showing how to generate a secure\r\nsecret (e.g., \"NEXTAUTH_SECRET=\" followed by a comment suggesting `openssl rand\r\n-base64 32` or `node -e\r\n\"console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('base64'))\"`); ensure\r\nthe file no longer contains the predictable string \"change-me-in-production\" and\r\nthat the comment clearly instructs developers to set NEXTAUTH_SECRET in\r\nproduction.\r\n\r\nIn `@web/Dockerfile`:\r\n- Around line 41-42: Consolidate the two consecutive RUN instructions into a\r\nsingle RUN to reduce image layers: combine the addgroup and adduser commands\r\n(the lines with \"addgroup --system --gid 1001 nodejs\" and \"adduser --system\r\n--uid 1001 nextjs\") using shell chaining (&& and line continuations) so they\r\nexecute in one layer, preserving exact flags and ordering, and ensure the\r\ncombined RUN still fails fast on error by keeping the shell semantics.\r\n- Line 49: The COPY of the public directory is missing ownership change and will\r\nleave files owned by root; update the Dockerfile COPY statement that moves\r\n/app/web/public to ./web/public (the COPY --from=builder line) to include\r\n--chown=nextjs:nodejs so the public directory and its contents are owned by the\r\nnextjs user (matching the earlier COPY lines that used --chown=nextjs:nodejs).\r\n- Around line 34-58: Add a Docker HEALTHCHECK to the Dockerfile so container\r\nscanners stop flagging it; insert a HEALTHCHECK line (after EXPOSE 3000 or\r\nbefore CMD) that polls the app's /api/health endpoint (e.g., curl --fail\r\nhttp://localhost:${PORT:-3000}/api/health) with sensible parameters (interval,\r\ntimeout, start-period, retries) so the container runtime can detect unhealthy\r\napp instances; keep the existing ENV PORT=3000 and CMD [\"node\", \"web/server.js\"]\r\nunchanged.\r\n\r\nIn `@web/package.json`:\r\n- Line 9: Update the package.json scripts so the current \"lint\" entry is renamed\r\nto \"typecheck\" (since \"tsc --noEmit\" only type-checks) and add a proper \"lint\"\r\nscript that runs ESLint; ensure ESLint is installed and configured for the\r\nproject and include \"eslint-plugin-react-hooks\" (recommended for React 19) in\r\nthe devDependencies and ESLint config so the lint script checks code quality and\r\nReact hook rules while \"typecheck\" continues to run \"tsc --noEmit\".\r\n- Around line 23-24: The package.json declares \"next\": \"^16.1.6\" and\r\n\"next-auth\": \"^4.24.13\", but NextAuth v4 is incompatible with Next.js 16 due to\r\npeer dependency restrictions; either downgrade \"next\" to a 15.x line or upgrade\r\nauthentication to Auth.js v5 by updating \"next-auth\" to a v5-compatible version\r\n(e.g., \"^5.x\") and applying the required code changes: move/convert your auth\r\nconfig into a root-level auth.ts and rename any Next.js 16 middleware file named\r\nmiddleware.ts to proxy.ts, then update imports/usages that reference NextAuth v4\r\nAPIs to the Auth.js v5 equivalents.\r\n\r\nIn `@web/railway.toml`:\r\n- Around line 8-9: The healthcheckTimeout currently set to 300 in the railway\r\nconfiguration is too large; update the healthcheckTimeout value in the\r\nrailway.toml (the healthcheckTimeout key alongside healthcheckPath) to a lower\r\nsensible value (e.g., 60–120) that matches expected cold-start time so failures\r\nare detected faster, and commit the modified railway.toml with the new timeout.\r\n\r\nIn `@web/src/app/error.tsx`:\r\n- Around line 13-44: Create a new global-error.tsx that exports a default\r\ncomponent to catch root-layout errors: copy the UI from the existing GlobalError\r\nfunction (Card, CardHeader, CardContent, display error.digest) but change the\r\ncomponent signature to accept only { error }: { error: Error & { digest?: string\r\n} } (no reset), wrap the returned JSX in explicit <html><body>...</body></html>\r\n(Next.js requirement for global-error replacing root layout), and call\r\nconsole.error(\"[global-error]\", error) on mount so root errors are logged;\r\nensure the component is the default export named GlobalError (or equivalent) so\r\nNext.js picks it up.\r\n\r\nIn `@web/src/app/login/page.tsx`:\r\n- Around line 28-40: The page currently only early-returns while status ===\r\n\"loading\", causing a flash of the login UI when status is already\r\n\"authenticated\"; add an early return when session/status indicates an\r\nauthenticated user (check session or status === \"authenticated\") before\r\nrendering the sign-in card, and perform the redirect with\r\nrouter.push(callbackUrl) inside useEffect as-is—update the component in page.tsx\r\n(the useEffect/session/status logic) to return null or a loader immediately when\r\nauthenticated to avoid the flash.\r\n- Around line 3-6: There are two separate React imports (Suspense and\r\nuseEffect); consolidate them into a single import from \"react\" (e.g., import {\r\nSuspense, useEffect } from \"react\") and remove the duplicate import line so that\r\nthe file only imports signIn and useSession from \"next-auth/react\" and\r\nuseRouter/useSearchParams from \"next/navigation\" as before.\r\n\r\nIn `@web/src/app/page.tsx`:\r\n- Around line 60-71: InviteButton currently wraps a Button (which renders a\r\n<button>) inside an <a>, violating HTML nesting rules; change InviteButton to\r\navoid nesting interactive elements by using the Button component's asChild prop\r\nso the styled Button will render an anchor instead: call getBotInviteUrl() as\r\nbefore, remove the outer <a>, render Button with asChild and pass the anchor\r\nattributes (href, target, rel) to the child anchor element so the final DOM is a\r\nsingle <a> with Button styles and no nested <button>.\r\n- Around line 86-90: Replace the current pattern that nests a <Button> inside a\r\n<Link> (creating a button inside an anchor) by using the Button's asChild prop\r\nand rendering the Next.js <Link> as the Button's child; specifically update the\r\nnavbar \"Sign In\" instance and the hero \"Open Dashboard\" instance so they read\r\nlike <Button asChild><Link href=\"/...\">Sign In</Link></Button> (and similarly\r\nfor \"Open Dashboard\"), keeping the Button props (variant, size, etc.) on Button\r\nand the href on Link so the DOM renders a single anchor element styled as the\r\nButton.\r\n\r\nIn `@web/src/components/layout/header.tsx`:\r\n- Around line 63-73: The \"Discord Developer Portal\" menu entry (the\r\nDropdownMenuItem containing the <a> with href\r\n\"https://discord.com/developers/applications\" and the ExternalLink icon) is\r\ndeveloper-focused and should be replaced or removed; update the DropdownMenuItem\r\nto point to a user-facing resource (for example the bot support server URL or\r\nproduct documentation) and change the link text accordingly, or remove the\r\nentire DropdownMenuItem block if no replacement is appropriate, ensuring to keep\r\ntarget=\"_blank\" and rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" if you add an external link.\r\n- Around line 17-84: The Header component uses useSession() but only checks\r\nsession?.user, causing the avatar area to be empty during loading; update Header\r\nto read the status from useSession() and render a fixed-size skeleton\r\nplaceholder (e.g., a h-8 w-8 rounded-full animated/pulse div) while status ===\r\n\"loading\" to prevent layout shift, keep the existing\r\nAvatar/AvatarImage/AvatarFallback rendering when status === \"authenticated\" and\r\nsession.user exists, and handle \"unauthenticated\" (keep current empty state or\r\nshow a sign-in control) so the layout remains stable; ensure the skeleton has\r\nthe same container classNames used by the Avatar/Button to preserve spacing.\r\n\r\nIn `@web/src/components/layout/server-selector.tsx`:\r\n- Around line 92-107: The retry button calls loadGuilds() without an\r\nAbortSignal, allowing overlapping fetches that can race\r\nsetGuilds/setSelectedGuild; fix by wiring an AbortController into the retry\r\nflow: add a persistent ref (e.g., abortControllerRef) that you abort() before\r\neach retry, create a new AbortController, pass its signal into loadGuilds (or\r\nchange loadGuilds to accept a signal parameter), and ensure loadGuilds respects\r\nsignal to cancel and not call setGuilds/setSelectedGuild for aborted/stale\r\nresponses (alternatively track a requestId and ignore out-of-order responses).\r\n- Around line 132-157: Replace the template literal used in the Button's\r\nclassName inside DropdownMenuTrigger with the project's cn() utility so\r\nfalsy/undefined values are handled consistently; locate the Button component in\r\nserver-selector.tsx (inside the DropdownMenuTrigger block) where\r\nclassName={`w-full justify-between ${className ?? \"\"}`} is used and change it to\r\nuse cn(\"w-full justify-between\", className) (import cn at top if missing).\r\n\r\nIn `@web/src/components/layout/sidebar.tsx`:\r\n- Around line 64-87: The isActive calculation in the sidebar nav uses\r\npathname.startsWith(item.href) which can falsely match overlapping prefixes;\r\nupdate the isActive assignment in the nav mapping (the variable named isActive\r\ninside the map over navigation in the Sidebar component) to use an exact match\r\nOR a prefix followed by a slash—e.g. keep pathname === item.href and change the\r\nsecond condition to pathname.startsWith(item.href + \"/\")—so only true subpaths\r\nof the item.href are considered active; update the isActive expression\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\nIn `@web/src/components/providers.tsx`:\r\n- Around line 14-19: The useEffect that calls signIn(\"discord\") when\r\nsession?.error === \"RefreshTokenError\" can trigger multiple times; add a\r\nref-based guard (e.g., hasRedirectedRef via useRef(false)) inside the component,\r\ncheck hasRedirectedRef.current before calling signIn in the useEffect, set\r\nhasRedirectedRef.current = true immediately after invoking signIn, and keep the\r\neffect dependency on session?.error so repeated renders won't re-trigger signIn;\r\nreference the existing useEffect, signIn, and session?.error and add useRef\r\n(hasRedirectedRef) to implement the guard.\r\n- Around line 1-30: The project is using Next.js 16 which is incompatible with\r\nNextAuth v4/v5; update the repo to a supported setup by either (A)\r\npinning/downgrading Next.js back to a v15-compatible release and reinstalling\r\ndependencies so NextAuth (and the SessionProvider/SessionGuard using\r\nuseSession/signIn) remains on supported peer deps, or (B) if you must stay on\r\nNext.js 16, revert any NextAuth/Auth.js upgrades and remove/hold any changes\r\nrelying on SessionProvider/SessionGuard until Auth.js officially adds Next 16\r\nsupport; ensure package.json reflects the chosen option and then run a clean\r\ninstall without forcing peer deps.\r\n\r\nIn `@web/src/components/ui/card.tsx`:\r\n- Around line 31-41: The CardTitle forwardRef has a ref type mismatch: it\r\ncurrently declares the ref generic as HTMLParagraphElement while rendering an\r\n<h3> (HTMLHeadingElement). Update the forwardRef generic to use\r\nHTMLHeadingElement (so the signature becomes\r\nReact.forwardRef<HTMLHeadingElement, React.HTMLAttributes<HTMLHeadingElement>>\r\nfor CardTitle) to align the ref type with the rendered element and keep\r\nCardTitle.displayName unchanged.\r\n\r\nIn `@web/src/components/ui/separator.tsx`:\r\n- Around line 7-28: The component uses React.forwardRef (Separator) which is\r\nunnecessary in React 19; replace the forwardRef wrapper with a normal function\r\ncomponent that accepts ref as a regular prop and forwards it to\r\nSeparatorPrimitive.Root, keeping the same props and default values (className,\r\norientation = \"horizontal\", decorative = true, ...props). Update the component\r\nsignature to accept a ref prop (typed consistently with\r\nSeparatorPrimitive.Root's element type) and pass that ref into\r\n<SeparatorPrimitive.Root ref={ref} ... />, and keep Separator.displayName =\r\nSeparatorPrimitive.Root.displayName.\r\n\r\nIn `@web/src/components/ui/sheet.tsx`:\r\n- Around line 99-108: The file is missing exporting SheetDescription which\r\ncauses Radix to warn about a missing accessible Description; add and export the\r\nSheetDescription component alongside SheetTitle in the export block so consumers\r\ncan import it (ensure the named export SheetDescription is defined/imported\r\nwhere Sheet, SheetContent, SheetHeader, SheetTitle etc. are defined and then\r\ninclude SheetDescription in the exported list: Sheet, SheetPortal, SheetOverlay,\r\nSheetTrigger, SheetClose, SheetContent, SheetHeader, SheetTitle,\r\nSheetDescription).\r\n\r\nIn `@web/src/lib/auth.ts`:\r\n- Around line 90-113: The jwt callback is setting token.accessTokenExpires to\r\nundefined when account.expires_at is missing which causes every request to\r\ntrigger refreshDiscordToken; update the jwt({ token, account }) logic to assign\r\na sensible default expiry when account.expires_at is falsy (for example\r\nDate.now() + 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000) so token.accessTokenExpires is always a\r\nnumber after initial sign-in, keep using the existing expiresAt check and return\r\npaths, and ensure the change is applied where token.accessTokenExpires is set\r\n(in the jwt function) so refreshDiscordToken is only called when the expiry is\r\nactually passed.\r\n- Around line 78-88: The Discord OAuth credentials are silently defaulting to\r\nempty strings; update module-level validation in web/src/lib/auth.ts to check\r\nDISCORD_CLIENT_ID and DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET (the env vars used when constructing\r\nDiscordProvider) the same way NEXTAUTH_SECRET is validated: detect missing/empty\r\nvalues at startup and throw or exit with a clear error message instead of using\r\nthe \"\" fallback so DiscordProvider is never initialized with invalid\r\ncredentials.\r\n\r\nIn `@web/src/lib/discord.server.ts`:\r\n- Around line 152-176: getMutualGuilds currently doesn't accept or forward an\r\nAbortSignal so paginated fetches (via fetchUserGuilds) can't be cancelled;\r\nupdate getMutualGuilds signature to accept an optional signal: AbortSignal |\r\nundefined, pass that signal into fetchUserGuilds(signal) when calling\r\nPromise.all (and into fetchBotGuilds if it supports signals), and update any\r\ncallers to forward their request signal—this ensures the user guild fetch can be\r\naborted when the client disconnects.\r\n\r\nIn `@web/src/lib/discord.ts`:\r\n- Around line 54-58: The code calling BigInt(userId) can throw on empty or\r\nnon-numeric input; update the avatar index computation in the block where\r\navatarHash is falsy to defensively validate userId before using BigInt (or wrap\r\nthe BigInt conversion in try/catch) and fall back to a safe index; specifically,\r\ncheck that userId is a non-empty numeric string (e.g., /^[0-9]+$/) before\r\ncomputing Number(BigInt(userId) >> 22n) % 6, otherwise use a deterministic\r\nfallback (like 0) and keep the existing discriminator-based fallback\r\n(Number(discriminator) % 5) so the function using avatarHash, userId,\r\ndiscriminator and DISCORD_CDN never throws on invalid input.\r\n\r\nIn `@web/tests/app/dashboard.test.tsx`:\r\n- Around line 4-8: The mock for DashboardShell references the React namespace\r\ntype React.ReactNode but React is not imported, causing a TS error; fix by\r\neither adding an import for React (import React from \"react\" or a type-only\r\nimport like import type { ReactNode } from \"react\") and update the prop type to\r\nReactNode, or simply replace the type annotation in the DashboardShell mock (the\r\nmock factory passed to vi.mock) with an inline/primitive type (e.g., any or\r\nunknown) to avoid referencing React; update the mock that defines DashboardShell\r\nto use the chosen import or alternate type.\r\n\r\nIn `@web/tests/app/landing.test.tsx`:\r\n- Line 1: Remove the unused import by deleting \"beforeEach\" from the import list\r\nin this test file; update the import statement that currently imports describe,\r\nit, expect, beforeEach so it only imports describe, it, and expect (leave the\r\nexisting symbols describe, it, expect intact).\r\n- Around line 27-38: The tests mutate NEXT_PUBLIC_DISCORD_CLIENT_ID directly and\r\nrisk leaking state; refactor the \"hides Add to Server button...\" and \"shows Add\r\nto Server buttons...\" specs to save the original\r\nprocess.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_DISCORD_CLIENT_ID before each test and restore it after\r\neach test (use beforeEach/afterEach), or use a scoped helper that sets the env\r\nfor the test and restores it in an afterEach; update the tests around\r\nLandingPage rendering to ensure process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_DISCORD_CLIENT_ID is\r\nrestored even if assertions fail so no subsequent tests read a mutated env.\r\n\r\nIn `@web/tests/app/login.test.tsx`:\r\n- Around line 20-66: Add a test that simulates an authenticated session so the\r\nLoginForm's useEffect path is exercised: mock the session hook to return {\r\nstatus: \"authenticated\", data: { user: {...} } } and set mockSearchParams (e.g.,\r\n\"callbackUrl=/servers/123\"), render <LoginPage /> then await and assert that the\r\nrouter.push mock (mockRouter.push or the mocked next/router instance used in\r\ntests) was called with the expected callbackUrl; keep existing mocks like\r\nmockSignIn intact and clear before the test.\r\n- Around line 29-32: Replace usages of .toBeDefined() on assertions that call\r\nscreen.getByText(...) with .toBeInTheDocument() so the tests assert DOM presence\r\ncorrectly (for example change expect(screen.getByText(\"Welcome to Bill\r\nBot\")).toBeDefined() and expect(screen.getByText(\"Sign in with\r\nDiscord\")).toBeDefined() to .toBeInTheDocument()). Update all occurrences in\r\nthis file (lines referenced: the getByText assertions at 29, 31, 37, 49, 61).\r\nAlso ensure `@testing-library/jest-dom` is imported (e.g., import\r\n'@testing-library/jest-dom') so .toBeInTheDocument() matcher is available.\r\n\r\nIn `@web/tests/components/layout/dashboard-shell.test.tsx`:\r\n- Around line 26-28: Replace tautological DOM assertions that use\r\nexpect(screen.getByTestId(...)).toBeDefined() with\r\nexpect(...).toBeInTheDocument() (e.g., for \"header\", \"sidebar\", \"content\" in\r\ndashboard-shell.test.tsx); locate and update any other tests in this PR\r\n(sidebar, providers, etc.) that use toBeDefined() with getByTestId/getByText and\r\nswitch them to toBeInTheDocument(), relying on `@testing-library/jest-dom`\r\nimported in setup.ts for clearer intent and better failure messages.\r\n\r\nIn `@web/tests/components/layout/server-selector.test.tsx`:\r\n- Around line 57-64: The test for ServerSelector's error state should also\r\nassert that clicking the \"Retry\" button triggers a new fetch and updates the UI;\r\nupdate the \"shows error state with retry button on fetch failure\" test to (1)\r\nset global.fetch to a vi.fn() that first rejects (network error) and then\r\nresolves with the expected server payload on subsequent call, (2) render\r\n<ServerSelector />, wait for the error UI, (3) simulate a click on the \"Retry\"\r\nbutton (using fireEvent.click or userEvent.click), and (4) assert that\r\nglobal.fetch was called again and/or that the successful server list (or success\r\nUI) is rendered after the retry; reference the ServerSelector component and the\r\ntest block name to locate where to change the mocks and add the click/assertion.\r\n- Around line 14-16: The test suite uses vi.restoreAllMocks() which does not\r\nundo direct assignments to global.fetch; update the tests that set global.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS: Evaluate this email.
