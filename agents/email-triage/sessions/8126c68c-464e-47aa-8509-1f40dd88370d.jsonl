Here are a few hard truths:\r\n\r\n\r\n\t- Accurate measurement is hard to achieve when your data is fragmented, especially post-iOS 14. \r\n\t- Marketers also have more sources of data than ever - SKAN, aggregated data, MMP attribution, and incrementality to name a few.\r\n\t- All that measurement noise can lead to duplicated or unreliable results and bad decisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bottom line is you need to extract the insights that matter to make good marketing choices. \r\n\r\nCheck out this guide to get started with accurate measurement that drowns out the noise like a good pair of headphones. It’s time to take data-backed action.\r\nHappy reading,\r\nMicky from AppsFlyer\r\n\r\nPS: Here's a sneak peek <https://learn.appsflyer.com/MTA4LUFWVC03MzIAAAGgBbolZiX_jY3XVX6XABokIM44KcodTCzn8qu3_4AUajZXW-ZEr0Dq-mHrjbthyZ5ByhhfBSM-BKDW6GQ=> at what you should measure; the best app marketing KPIs.\r\nAppsFlyer&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100 1 st street&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CA&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;94105&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;USA\r\nUnsubscribe <[[https://go.appsflyer.com/UnsubscribePage.html?mkt_unsubscribe=1&mkt_tok=MTA4LUFWVC03MzIAAAGgBbolZsDp7pL5x921zP0WHdp4gJt2ynMNK0tZYZriQBZOxoWvRx4WJE83hA6jYsPlpfAOg2hyIyfyNyOa74tvBnd25nwiDQjrlnpdsTBelVbYDidWu0ao_D4kEg]]> from all marketing emails\r\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS: Evaluate this email.
