I've reviewed the key files across authentication, Discord API integration, components, deployment configuration, and testing.\r\n\r\n**Key findings:**\r\n- ✅ Security practices are solid (tokens kept server-side, NEXTAUTH_SECRET validation rejects placeholders, proper security headers in next.config.ts)\r\n- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage with 80% threshold enforced\r\n- ✅ Good error handling patterns (token refresh errors propagated to client, rate limit retries with abort signal support)\r\n- ✅ Clean separation between server-only and client code\r\n- ✅ Proper TypeScript type augmentation for NextAuth\r\n- ✅ Docker multi-stage build with HEALTHCHECK\r\n- ✅ CI passing\r\n\r\n**No critical or warning-level issues found.** The previous review comments from multiple reviewers have been thoroughly addressed.\r\n\r\n---\r\n*Review completed by Claude*\r\n\r\n--\r\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\r\nhttps://github.com/BillChirico/bills-bot/pull/60#issuecomment-3905973261\r\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\r\n\r\nMessage ID: <BillChirico/bills-bot/pull/60/c3905973261@github.com>\n\nINSTRUCTIONS: Evaluate this email.
