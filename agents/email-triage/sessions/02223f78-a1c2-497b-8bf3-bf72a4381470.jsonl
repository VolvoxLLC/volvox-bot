Since `set index` reorders windows immediately, each subsequent match pushes the previous one down. Result: the **last** matching window ends up focused, not the first.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, mutating the window list while iterating over it is technically undefined behavior in AppleScript (though in practice it usually doesn't crash).\r\n\r\n**Recommended fix** — add `exit repeat` as CodeRabbit suggests:\r\n\r\n```go\r\nreturn fmt.Sprintf(\r\n    \"osascript -e 'tell application id \\\"%s\\\"' -e 'activate' -e 'set _n to \\\"%s\\\"' -e 'repeat with w in windows' -e 'if name of w contains _n then' -e 'set index of w to 1' -e 'exit repeat' -e 'end if' -e 'end repeat' -e 'end tell'\",\r\n    safeBundleID, safeFolder,\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is cleaner, more predictable, and avoids unnecessary iteration.
