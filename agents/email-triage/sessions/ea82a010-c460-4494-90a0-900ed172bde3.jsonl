The arrow function needs reformatting.\r\n\r\n### 🟡 Warning (2)\r\n- **src/transports/postgres.js:120** — Unbounded buffer growth during DB outages. Failed entries are re-queued but there's no max buffer size limit, which can cause memory exhaustion.\r\n- **src/index.js:309** — `initLogsTable` call is redundant (already called in `db.js`) and NOT wrapped in try/catch, risking startup crash if it fails.\r\n\r\n### 🔵 Nitpick (1)\r\n- **src/logger.js:269-272** — `removePostgresTransport` should use try/finally to ensure `logger.remove()` is always called even if `close()` throws.\r\n\r\nPlease fix the critical CI failure and address the warnings before merging.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--\r\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\r\nhttps://github.com/BillChirico/bills-bot/pull/65#pullrequestreview-3810980519\r\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\r\n\r\nMessage ID: <BillChirico/bills-bot/pull/65/review/3810980519@github.com>\n\nINSTRUCTIONS: Evaluate this email.
