''`)\r\n2. ✅ **formatRelations undefined** - Filters incomplete relations with `.filter((r) => r.source && r.relationship && r.target)`\r\n3. ✅ **buildMemoryContext timeout** - Uses `Promise.race` with 5s timeout\r\n4. ✅ **Fire-and-forget extractAndStoreMemories** - Only logs errors, doesn't call `markUnavailable()`\r\n5. ✅ **checkMem0Health timeout** - Uses `Promise.race` with 10s timeout and `AbortController` to prevent late resolution race\r\n6. ✅ **isMemoryAvailable pure** - Renamed recovery version to `checkAndRecoverMemory()`\r\n7. ✅ **Forget topic batching** - Loops with batch size 100, max 10 iterations (1000 memories max)\r\n8. ✅ **Memory context size budget** - 2000-char limit with truncation\r\n9. ✅ **Username in metadata** - Passes username as metadata only\r\n\r\nPrevious review issues addressed:\r\n- Cursor bot's falsy ID coercion issue: Fixed with `m.id ?? ''` at lines 365/399\r\n- Cursor bot's health check timeout issue: Fixed with `markUnavailable()` and `AbortSignal`\r\n\r\n**Approved** ✅\r\n\r\n--\r\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\r\nhttps://github.com/BillChirico/bills-bot/pull/63#issuecomment-3906136330\r\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\r\n\r\nMessage ID: <BillChirico/bills-bot/pull/63/c3906136330@github.com>\n\nINSTRUCTIONS: Evaluate this email.
