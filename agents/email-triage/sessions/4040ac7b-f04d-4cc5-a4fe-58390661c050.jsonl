A search for `%` would match all messages.\r\n   - **Fix:** Escape wildcards before wrapping: `options.search.replace(/[%_]/g, '\\\\$&')`\r\n\r\n2. **Missing documentation for new files**\r\n   - Per AGENTS.md conventions, new files should be documented in the Key Files table:\r\n     - `src/transports/postgres.js` — Custom Winston transport for PostgreSQL logging\r\n     - `src/utils/logQuery.js` — Query utility for logs table\r\n   - The new `logging.database` config section should be documented in README.md's config reference\r\n\r\n### 🔵 Nitpicks\r\n\r\n1. **No validation on level parameter** (`src/utils/logQuery.js:32`)\r\n   - The `level` parameter is passed without validation. Consider validating against allowed levels (`error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nPlease address the warnings above. The code is otherwise well-structured with proper parameterized queries, graceful failure handling, and comprehensive test coverage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--\r\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\r\nhttps://github.com/BillChirico/bills-bot/pull/65#pullrequestreview-3810852495\r\nYou are receiving this because you authored the thread.\r\n\r\nMessage ID: <BillChirico/bills-bot/pull/65/review/3810852495@github.com>\n\nINSTRUCTIONS: Evaluate this email.
