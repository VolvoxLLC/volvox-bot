After thorough review of all 17 changed files:\r\n\r\n**Code Quality:** Clean ESM modules, proper Winston logging (no console.*), single quotes, semicolons, 2-space indentation — all conventions followed.\r\n\r\n**Architecture:** Proper separation of concerns with `memory.js` (SDK wrapper), `optout.js` (user preference persistence), and `memory.js` command. Config accessed via `getConfig()`, new DB table properly added in `db.js`.\r\n\r\n**Error Handling:** Intelligent transient vs permanent error classification with auto-recovery cooldown. Graceful fallbacks ensure the bot works when mem0 is unavailable.\r\n\r\n**Testing:** Comprehensive test coverage with 890 lines for memory module and 887 lines for command tests. CI passing with 80%+ coverage threshold met.\r\n\r\n**Security:** No hardcoded credentials, API key read from env, user opt-out persisted to DB, ephemeral replies for sensitive data, admin permission checks implemented.\r\n\r\n**Documentation:** `.env.example` updated with `MEM0_API_KEY`, `config.json` documented with memory section.\r\n\r\nAll previous review feedback from coderabbitai, cursor, and claude has been addressed in the latest commits.\r\n\r\n--\r\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\r\nhttps://github.com/BillChirico/bills-bot/pull/59#issuecomment-3905961295\r\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\r\n\r\nMessage ID: <BillChirico/bills-bot/pull/59/c3905961295@github.com>\n\nINSTRUCTIONS: Evaluate this email.
