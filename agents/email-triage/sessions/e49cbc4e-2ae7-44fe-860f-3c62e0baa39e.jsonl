This can cause listeners to be skipped when `splice()` shifts elements down.\r\n\r\n**Fix:** Change line 188 from:\r\n```javascript\r\nfor (const listener of listeners) {\r\n```\r\nto:\r\n```javascript\r\nfor (const listener of [...listeners]) {\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis creates a snapshot of the array before iteration, ensuring all listeners registered at the time of the event are called regardless of mid-iteration mutations.\r\n\r\n--\r\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\r\nhttps://github.com/BillChirico/bills-bot/pull/67#issuecomment-3911169419\r\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\r\n\r\nMessage ID: <BillChirico/bills-bot/pull/67/c3911169419@github.com>\n\nINSTRUCTIONS: Evaluate this email.
