For jobs that only read repository files and do not call the GitHub API or push changes, we should set `contents: read`. This documents the intent and prevents accidental escalation if repository defaults change.\r\n\r\nThe `validate-plugin` job only checks out the repo and runs shell/python commands against files; it does not need to write via the GitHub API, so we should add `permissions: contents: read` under that job. The `summary` job only writes to `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`, which does not require any special token permissions beyond reads of workflow context/outputs, so we should also give it `contents: read`. No changes are needed to `cleanup-name-attributes`, which already has a suitable `permissions` block.\r\n\r\nConcretely:\r\n- In `.github/workflows/cleanup-commands.yml`, under `validate-plugin` (around line 151–154), insert:\r\n  ```yaml\r\n    permissions:\r\n      contents: read\r\n  ```\r\n- Under `summary` (around line 209–212), insert:\r\n  ```yaml\r\n    permissions:\r\n      contents: read\r\n  ```\r\nNo imports or additional methods are required, since this is entirely within the workflow YAML.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Suggested fixes powered by Copilot Autofix.
