The implementation is well-structured with proper error handling, test coverage, and follows project conventions.\r\n\r\n### Tasks\r\n- [x] Read AGENTS.md for project conventions\r\n- [x] Review src/transports/postgres.js\r\n- [x] Review src/utils/logQuery.js\r\n- [x] Review src/logger.js changes\r\n- [x] Review src/db.js changes\r\n- [x] Review src/index.js changes\r\n- [x] Review test files\r\n- [x] Check config.json changes\r\n- [x] Verify previous review issues are addressed\r\n- [x] Fix lint error (import ordering in src/index.js)\r\n- [x] Commit fix and push\r\n- [x] Submit review verdict\r\n\r\n### Fixed Issues\r\n\r\nI fixed a lint error where imports in `src/index.js` were not sorted according to Biome's `organizeImports` rule. The `./transports/postgres.js` import needed to be moved after `./modules/` imports.\r\n\r\n### Previous Review Issues — All Addressed\r\n\r\n| Issue | Status | Fix |\r\n|-------|--------|-----|\r\n| ILIKE wildcards not escaped | ✅ | `escapeIlike()` function escapes `%`, `_`, `\\` |\r\n| Timestamp format lacking timezone | ✅ | Uses `winston.format.timestamp()` for ISO 8601 |\r\n| Resource leak in `removePostgresTransport` | ✅ | Now awaits `transport.close()` |\r\n| `retentionDays` validation | ✅ | Returns 0 for invalid/non-positive values |\r\n| `initLogsTable` transaction wrapping | ✅ | Wrapped in `BEGIN`/`COMMIT` with `ROLLBACK` on error |\r\n| Database logging never activates | ✅ | Wired up in `src/index.js` startup |\r\n| Log retention never enforced | ✅ | `pruneOldLogs` called on startup |\r\n| Flush data loss on failure | ✅ | Entries restored to buffer via `unshift()` |\r\n| Level validation | ✅ | `ALLOWED_LEVELS` validation in logQuery.js |\r\n| Query errors not logged | ✅ | Uses `warn()` from logger |\r\n\r\n### Code Quality Verification\r\n\r\n- ✅ No `console.*` calls in src/ files (Winston used exclusively)\r\n- ✅ No `require()` calls (ESM modules only)\r\n- ✅ All Node.js imports use `node:` protocol\r\n- ✅ JSDoc comments on all exported functions\r\n- ✅ Parameterized SQL queries (no SQL injection)\r\n- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage for new files\r\n- ✅ Graceful failure handling throughout\r\n |\r\n\r\n--\r\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\r\nhttps://github.com/BillChirico/bills-bot/pull/65#issuecomment-3910872068\r\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\r\n\r\nMessage ID: <BillChirico/bills-bot/pull/65/c3910872068@github.com>\n\nINSTRUCTIONS: Evaluate this email.
