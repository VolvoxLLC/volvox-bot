The architecture follows good patterns with proper separation of concerns, comprehensive error handling, and security considerations.\r\n\r\n### Minor Issues (addressed via inline comments)\r\n\r\n1. **Unused import** in `web/src/components/error-card.tsx` - `Button` is imported but not used\r\n2. **Redundant URL parsing** in `web/src/proxy.ts` - can use `request.nextUrl.pathname` directly\r\n\r\n### Strengths Observed\r\n- Proper JWT session strategy with token refresh handling\r\n- Graceful degradation when bot API is unavailable\r\n- AbortController cleanup in useEffect hooks\r\n- Rate limit retry logic with backoff\r\n- NEXTAUTH_SECRET validation rejects placeholder values\r\n- Access token kept server-side (not exposed to client session)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n*Reviewed by Claude*\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\r\nhttps://github.com/BillChirico/bills-bot/pull/60#pullrequestreview-3809121521\r\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\r\n\r\nMessage ID: <BillChirico/bills-bot/pull/60/review/3809121521@github.com>\n\nINSTRUCTIONS: Evaluate this email.
