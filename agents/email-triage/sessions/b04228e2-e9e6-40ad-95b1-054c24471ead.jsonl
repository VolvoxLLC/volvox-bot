The implementation is well-architected with good test coverage, but there's one critical issue that must be fixed.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 🔴 Critical Issue (1)\r\n\r\n| Issue | Location | Description |\r\n|-------|----------|-------------|\r\n| Opt-out state not loaded on startup | `src/index.js:294` | `loadOptOuts()` is never called during startup. After a bot restart, opted-out users' messages will be sent to mem0, violating their privacy choice. |\r\n\r\n### 🟡 Warnings (1)\r\n\r\n| Issue | Location | Description |\r\n|-------|----------|-------------|\r\n| Memory defaults to enabled when config fails | `src/modules/memory.js:97` | The catch fallback defaults `enabled: true`. Consider `false` for fail-safe behavior. |\r\n\r\n### 🔵 Nitpicks (2)\r\n\r\n| Issue | Location | Description |\r\n|-------|----------|-------------|\r\n| Missing `markUnavailable()` in delete functions | `src/modules/memory.js:330` | Unlike other API functions, delete operations don't trigger the recovery cooldown on failure. |\r\n| Unawaited promise in test | `tests/modules/memory.test.js:149-176` | Test assertions inside `.then()` are not properly awaited. |\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### ✅ What's Good\r\n\r\n- Clean ESM module structure following project conventions\r\n- Proper Winston logging (no `console.*` usage)\r\n- Comprehensive test coverage (806+ lines of memory tests)\r\n- Good error handling with graceful fallbacks and auto-recovery cooldown\r\n- Proper use of `splitMessage()` utility for Discord limits\r\n- Well-documented JSDoc comments\r\n- Privacy notice in module header\r\n- Admin commands properly check permissions\r\n- Ephemeral replies for sensitive data\r\n- DB schema properly added for `memory_optouts` table\r\n- CI passing ✓\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSee inline comments for specific code locations and suggested fixes.\r\n\r\n--\r\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\r\nhttps://github.com/BillChirico/bills-bot/pull/59#issuecomment-3905961295\r\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\r\n\r\nMessage ID: <BillChirico/bills-bot/pull/59/c3905961295@github.com>\n\nINSTRUCTIONS: Evaluate this email.
