This causes a CPU spike for the entire duration of each move\r\n  operation.\r\n\r\n  ## Fix\r\n  Add `try await Task.sleep(for: .milliseconds(10))` — converts busy-wait into polling with sleep. 100 checks/second is more than sufficient for detecting item movement without\r\n  perceptible delay.\r\n\r\nYou can view, comment on, or merge this pull request online at:\r\n\r\n  https://github.com/stonerl/Thaw/pull/109\r\n\r\n-- Commit Summary --\r\n\r\n  * i18n(Thaw): add Traditional Chinese translations for various keys\r\n  * Merge branch &#39;stonerl:main&#39; into main\r\n  * Merge branch &#39;stonerl:main&#39; into main\r\n  * Merge branch &#39;stonerl:main&#39; into main\r\n  * Merge branch &#39;stonerl:main&#39; into main\r\n  * Merge branch &#39;stonerl:main&#39; into main\r\n  * Merge branch &#39;stonerl:main&#39; into main\r\n  * Merge branch &#39;stonerl:main&#39; into main\r\n  * perf(menubar): add delay to origin polling loop\r\n\r\n-- File Changes --\r\n\r\n    M Thaw/MenuBar/MenuBarItems/MenuBarItemManager.swift (1)\r\n\r\n-- Patch Links --\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/stonerl/Thaw/pull/109.patch\r\nhttps://github.com/stonerl/Thaw/pull/109.diff\r\n\r\n--\r\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\r\nhttps://github.com/stonerl/Thaw/pull/109\r\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\r\n\r\nMessage ID: &lt;stonerl/Thaw/pull/109@github.com&gt;\r\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS: Evaluate this email.
