I won't touch anything until you're done.\r\n\r\nJust leaving some notes on the merge conflicts for when you're ready to rebase onto main (after #32 was merged):\r\n\r\n### Conflicting files (4)\r\n\r\n**1. `internal/hooks/hooks.go`** — 2 conflicts, trivial\r\n\r\nBoth PRs added a third parameter to `SendDesktop`: we added `sessionID`, you added `cwd`. The merged signature should accept both:\r\n\r\n```go\r\nSendDesktop(status analyzer.Status, message, sessionID, cwd string) error\r\n```\r\n\r\nSame for the call site (~line 378) — pass both `sessionID` and `cwd`.\r\n\r\n**2. `internal/hooks/hooks_test.go`** — 1 conflict, trivial\r\n\r\nMock signature — just add both params to match the interface above.\r\n\r\n**3. `internal/notifier/notifier.go`** — 4 conflicts\r\n\r\n- `SendDesktop` signature: same as hooks — add both `sessionID` and `cwd`\r\n- `sendWithTerminalNotifier` signature: merge our params (`subtitle, sessionID string, timeSensitive bool`) with your `cwd string`\r\n- `sendWithTerminalNotifier` body (biggest one): we added tmux detection + subtitle/threadID/timeSensitive/nosound appending. Your version passes `cwd` to `buildTerminalNotifierArgs`. Both changes are needed — the tmux branch should call `buildTmuxNotifierArgs(...)`, the non-tmux branch should call your `buildTerminalNotifierArgs(..., cwd)`, and then our shared options (subtitle, threadID, timeSensitive, nosound) get appended after\r\n- `sendWithTerminalNotifier` call site: combine params\r\n\r\n**4. `internal/notifier/notifier_test.go`** — 4 conflicts\r\n\r\n- `SendDesktop` calls: just add both args (e.g. `\"test-session\", \"/some/path\"`)\r\n- Integration tests block (~line 632): take our version (just a comment pointing to `notifier_darwin_integration_test.go` where we moved them with a `//go:build darwin` tag to fix Ubuntu/Windows CI)\r\n- Test blocks at the end (~line 1006): **keep both** — our tests (isTimeSensitiveStatus, subtitle) and yours (buildFocusScript, sanitizeForAppleScript) are independent\r\n\r\nLet me know if you have any questions when you get to it!\r\n\r\n--\r\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\r\nhttps://github.com/777genius/claude-notifications-go/pull/31#issuecomment-3928758325\r\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\r\n\r\nMessage ID: <777genius/claude-notifications-go/pull/31/c3928758325@github.com>\n\nINSTRUCTIONS: Evaluate this email.
