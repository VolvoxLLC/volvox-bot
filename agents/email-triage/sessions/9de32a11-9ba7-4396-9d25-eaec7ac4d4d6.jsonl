Thanks for the great suggestion — this has been implemented! 🎉\r\n\r\nWe added two ways to discover available sounds:\r\n\r\n### 1. CLI command: `list-sounds`\r\nRun it directly to see all available notification sounds with preview capability:\r\n```bash\r\n./bin/list-sounds\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 2. Skill command: `/sounds`\r\nUse the `/claude-notifications-go:notifications-settings` skill within Claude Code to interactively browse and configure sounds.\r\n\r\n### What's included\r\n- Complete list of all available sound files (task-complete, review-complete, question, plan-ready)\r\n- Sound preview/playback directly from the CLI\r\n- Clear mapping of which sound is used for which notification status\r\n- Configuration examples for customizing sounds in `config.json`\r\n\r\nThis was shipped in commit a54ee00. Feel free to reopen if you have additional ideas for improving sound discovery!\r\n\r\n--\r\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\r\nhttps://github.com/777genius/claude-notifications-go/issues/23#issuecomment-3907363399\r\nYou are receiving this because you authored the thread.\r\n\r\nMessage ID: <777genius/claude-notifications-go/issues/23/3907363399@github.com>\n\nINSTRUCTIONS: Evaluate this email.
