The server selector becomes non-functional instead of gracefully degrading.\r\n   - Wrap the bot API call with try/catch to return `[]` on failure.\r\n\r\n2. **Standalone output path may be nested** (`web/Dockerfile:57`)\r\n   - With pnpm workspaces and Next.js 15.5+, the standalone output may place `server.js` at `.next/standalone/web/server.js`. Verify the actual output path and adjust `CMD` accordingly.\r\n\r\n**🔵 Nitpicks (3)**\r\n\r\n3. **console.* usage** (`web/src/lib/discord.ts:33,77`, `web/src/lib/auth.ts:31`, `web/src/components/layout/server-selector.tsx:67`)\r\n   - Multiple files use `console.warn`/`console.error`. Consider structured logging or suppressing in production.\r\n\r\nThe architecture, security patterns (token refresh, session handling, BOT_API_SECRET auth), and test coverage are good. Please address the warnings before merging.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--\r\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\r\nhttps://github.com/BillChirico/bills-bot/pull/60#pullrequestreview-3806267749\r\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\r\n\r\nMessage ID: <BillChirico/bills-bot/pull/60/review/3806267749@github.com>\n\nINSTRUCTIONS: Evaluate this email.
