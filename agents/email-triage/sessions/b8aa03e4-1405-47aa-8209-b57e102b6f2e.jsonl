The implementation is well-structured and follows best practices.\r\n\r\n### Security ✅\r\n\r\n- **NEXTAUTH_SECRET validation** — Rejects placeholders and secrets under 32 characters at startup\r\n- **Access token isolation** — Access tokens stay in the server-side JWT; only user ID is exposed to the client session\r\n- **Open redirect prevention** — `callbackUrl` validation in `/login` rejects absolute URLs and protocol-relative paths\r\n- **Bot API authentication** — Requires `BOT_API_SECRET` when `BOT_API_URL` is set; refuses unauthenticated requests\r\n- **Security headers** — X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, HSTS configured in `next.config.ts`\r\n\r\n### Code Quality ✅\r\n\r\n- **Token refresh handling** — Graceful degradation with error propagation to client session\r\n- **Rate limit handling** — `fetchWithRateLimit` with retry logic and abort signal support\r\n- **Guild pagination** — Cursor-based pagination for users in 200+ guilds\r\n- **AbortController cleanup** — Proper cleanup in `server-selector.tsx` to prevent state updates on unmounted components\r\n- **Error boundaries** — Root-level and dashboard-level error handling with retry capability\r\n\r\n### Testing ✅\r\n\r\n- **80% coverage threshold** enforced in `vitest.config.ts`\r\n- Comprehensive tests for auth callbacks, token refresh, Discord API functions, and components\r\n- Edge cases covered: network failures, non-JSON responses, token rotation, expired tokens\r\n\r\n### Architecture ✅\r\n\r\n- **Monorepo setup** — Clean pnpm workspace with separate `web/` package\r\n- **Multi-stage Docker build** — Optimized for standalone Next.js output in monorepo context\r\n- **Graceful degradation** — Dashboard remains functional when bot API is unavailable\r\n\r\n### Documentation ✅\r\n\r\n- README updated with web dashboard section, environment variables, and deployment instructions\r\n- Environment templates provided (`.env.example`, `.env.local.example`)\r\n\r\nNo blocking issues found. The implementation is production-ready.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--\r\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\r\nhttps://github.com/BillChirico/bills-bot/pull/60#pullrequestreview-3810261676\r\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\r\n\r\nMessage ID: <BillChirico/bills-bot/pull/60/review/3810261676@github.com>\n\nINSTRUCTIONS: Evaluate this email.
