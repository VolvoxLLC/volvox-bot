All other API functions (`addMemory`, `searchMemories`, `getMemories`, `extractAndStoreMemories`) consistently call `markUnavailable()` on failure to trigger the recovery cooldown.\r\n\r\nThis inconsistency means if mem0 goes down and the first failing operation is a delete (e.g., via `/memory forget`), the cooldown mechanism won't engage, allowing subsequent API calls to continue hitting the unavailable service.\r\n\r\nFor consistency, consider adding `markUnavailable()` to the catch blocks here and in `deleteMemory` at line 349.\r\n\r\n--\r\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\r\nhttps://github.com/BillChirico/bills-bot/pull/59#pullrequestreview-3806173275\r\nYou are receiving this because you were assigned.\r\n\r\nMessage ID: <BillChirico/bills-bot/pull/59/review/3806173275@github.com>\n\nINSTRUCTIONS: Evaluate this email.
