This is a real build-breaking bug.\r\n\r\nThe root cause: `sendLinuxNotification` signature was updated in `terminal_darwin.go` and `terminal_linux.go` to accept the new `cwd string` parameter, but `terminal_other.go` (build tag `!darwin && !linux`, used on Windows) was missed. The CI confirms it:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntoo many arguments in call to sendLinuxNotification\r\n    have (string, string, string, *config.Config, string)\r\n    want (string, string, string, *config.Config)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Recommended fix** — exactly what CodeRabbit suggests, just add the parameter to the stub (it's unused on Windows):\r\n\r\n```go\r\nfunc sendLinuxNotification(title, body, appIcon string, cfg *config.Config, cwd string) error {\r\n    return beeep.Notify(title, body, appIcon)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is a must-fix before merge.\r\n\r\n--\r\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\r\nhttps://github.com/777genius/claude-notifications-go/pull/31#discussion_r2826723174\r\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\r\n\r\nMessage ID: <777genius/claude-notifications-go/pull/31/review/3824615795@github.com>\n\nINSTRUCTIONS: Evaluate this email.
