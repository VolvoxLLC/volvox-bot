The code is well-structured with proper attention to security, error handling, and maintainability.\r\n\r\n### ✅ Strengths Observed\r\n\r\n**Security**\r\n- Proper security headers (X-Frame-Options, HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy)\r\n- NEXTAUTH_SECRET validation with minimum length and placeholder rejection\r\n- Open redirect protection in login callback URL validation\r\n- Access tokens kept server-side in JWT, only user ID exposed to client\r\n- RefreshTokenError handling at multiple layers (proxy, API routes, Header component)\r\n\r\n**Architecture**\r\n- Clean separation between server-only (`discord.server.ts`) and client utilities\r\n- Graceful degradation when bot API is unavailable\r\n- Proper AbortController usage for request cancellation\r\n- Discriminated union pattern for API availability (`BotGuildResult`)\r\n\r\n**Discord Integration**\r\n- Guild pagination for users in >200 servers\r\n- Rate limit retry logic with exponential backoff\r\n- Token refresh with rotation support\r\n\r\n**Testing**\r\n- 80% coverage threshold enforced\r\n- Tests cover auth callbacks, API routes, rate limiting, and pagination\r\n- Proper mock isolation per test\r\n\r\n**Documentation**\r\n- README.md updated with web dashboard section\r\n- `.env.example` includes all required variables with generation instructions\r\n\r\n### 🔵 Minor Suggestions (Non-blocking)\r\n\r\n1. `web/tests/middleware.test.ts`: Missing test for `RefreshTokenError` branch in proxy\r\n2. `web/src/lib/discord.ts`: `getUserAvatarUrl` is unused (documented for future use)\r\n\r\nThese are documented in inline comments.\r\n\r\n**Verdict: APPROVED** ✅\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--\r\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\r\nhttps://github.com/BillChirico/bills-bot/pull/60#pullrequestreview-3810116886\r\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\r\n\r\nMessage ID: <BillChirico/bills-bot/pull/60/review/3810116886@github.com>\n\nINSTRUCTIONS: Evaluate this email.
