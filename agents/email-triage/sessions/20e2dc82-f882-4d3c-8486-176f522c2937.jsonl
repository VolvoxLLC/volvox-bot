However, since `docker-compose.yml` uses `context: ./web`, it will look for `.dockerignore` in `./web/` (not the root), so this specific exclusion doesn't affect the web service build.\r\n\r\nThe real issue is that the comment \"Web dashboard (separate build context)\" is misleading. This exclusion affects only root-context Docker builds (the bot), which is correct behavior. Consider updating the comment to clarify:\r\n\r\n```suggestion\r\n# Web dashboard directory excluded from bot build context only\r\nweb\r\n```\r\n\r\n--\r\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\r\nhttps://github.com/BillChirico/bills-bot/pull/64#pullrequestreview-3810191387\r\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\r\n\r\nMessage ID: <BillChirico/bills-bot/pull/64/review/3810191387@github.com>\n\nINSTRUCTIONS: Evaluate this email.
