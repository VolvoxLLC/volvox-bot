Consider using a more explicit type guard:\r\n\r\n```suggestion\r\n    const guilds = await getMutualGuilds(token.accessToken as string);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe current code works because of the `!token?.accessToken` check, but the cast is implicit. Adding an explicit cast improves clarity for future maintainers.\r\n\r\n--\r\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\r\nhttps://github.com/BillChirico/bills-bot/pull/60#pullrequestreview-3809561889\r\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\r\n\r\nMessage ID: <BillChirico/bills-bot/pull/60/review/3809561889@github.com>\n\nINSTRUCTIONS: Evaluate this email.
