Found **1 critical issue**, **1 warning**, and **2 nitpicks**:\r\n\r\n| Severity | Issue | Location |\r\n|----------|-------|----------|\r\n| 🔴 Critical | Opt-out state not loaded on startup — privacy violation | `src/index.js:293` |\r\n| 🟡 Warning | Memory defaults to enabled when config fails | `src/modules/memory.js:97` |\r\n| 🔵 Nitpick | Missing `markUnavailable()` in delete functions | `src/modules/memory.js:329, 349` |\r\n| 🔵 Nitpick | Test has unawaited promise | `tests/modules/memory.test.js:176` |\r\n\r\nThe critical issue (`loadOptOuts()` not being called during startup) means that after a bot restart, previously opted-out users' messages will be sent to mem0, violating their explicit privacy choice.
