Now extracts only\r\n    its own tag via `.map` and uses `.removeDuplicates(by:)` with pixel-data\r\n    comparison to skip updates when the image content is identical.\r\n  - **LayoutBarContainer**: A single cache update cycle mutates the `$images`\r\n    dictionary 3-4 times (filter, cleanup, merge, eviction), causing 3-4\r\n    consecutive `layoutArrangedViews()` calls. Added `.debounce(for: 50ms)` to\r\n    coalesce these into a single relayout.\r\n\r\n  ### Before\r\n  With 30 items visible: 30 items x 3-4 mutations = 90-120 sink invocations per\r\n  cache update cycle, each triggering frame resize and redraw.\r\n\r\n  ### After\r\n  Only items whose image pixel data actually changed trigger `setFrameSize` +\r\n  `needsDisplay`, and relayout runs exactly once per update cycle.\r\n\r\n  ### Note on `removeDuplicates`\r\n  `CapturedImage` has auto-synthesized `Hashable` based on `CGImage` pointer\r\n  identity, which means `.removeDuplicates()` would be a no-op (new captures\r\n  always produce new `CGImage` instances). The custom comparator compares\r\n  `scale`, dimensions, and `dataProvider?.data` for true value equality.\r\n\r\n  ## Test plan\r\n  - [ ] Open Settings &gt; Menu Bar Layout — verify items display correctly\r\n  - [ ] Show/hide sections — verify layout bar updates without visual glitches\r\n  - [ ] Drag items to reorder — verify smooth drag-and-drop behavior\r\n  - [ ] Switch between spaces — verify images update correctly\r\n\r\nYou can view, comment on, or merge this pull request online at:\r\n\r\n  https://github.com/stonerl/Thaw/pull/161\r\n\r\n-- Commit Summary --\r\n\r\n  * perf(layoutbar): optimize image updates with debounce and deduplication\r\n\r\n-- File Changes --\r\n\r\n    M Thaw/MenuBar/LayoutBar/LayoutBarContainer.swift (1)\r\n    M Thaw/MenuBar/LayoutBar/LayoutBarItemView.swift (17)\r\n\r\n-- Patch Links --\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/stonerl/Thaw/pull/161.patch\r\nhttps://github.com/stonerl/Thaw/pull/161.diff\r\n\r\n--\r\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\r\nhttps://github.com/stonerl/Thaw/pull/161\r\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\r\n\r\nMessage ID: &lt;stonerl/Thaw/pull/161@github.com&gt;\r\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS: Evaluate this email.
