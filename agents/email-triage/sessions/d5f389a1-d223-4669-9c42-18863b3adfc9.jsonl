This is a well-structured web dashboard shell with solid security practices.\r\n\r\n### Security\r\n- Access tokens remain server-side in the JWT — not exposed to client sessions ✓\r\n- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` validation rejects placeholders and short values ✓\r\n- Defense-in-depth: auth checks in both proxy.ts and dashboard layout ✓\r\n- `RefreshTokenError` properly propagated and handled in Header component ✓\r\n- `cache: \"no-store\"` for user-specific Discord API requests ✓\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- Clean server/client separation with `\"server-only\"` imports ✓\r\n- Proper AbortController cleanup in ServerSelector ✓\r\n- Rate limit retry logic with MAX_RETRIES ✓\r\n- Cursor-based pagination for large guild lists ✓\r\n- Graceful degradation when bot API is unavailable ✓\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n- 80% coverage thresholds enforced ✓\r\n- Comprehensive tests for auth, token refresh, pagination, rate limiting ✓\r\n- Tests verify access token is NOT exposed to client ✓\r\n\r\n### Infrastructure\r\n- Multi-stage Docker build with non-root user ✓\r\n- Healthcheck endpoint configured ✓\r\n- Proper monorepo standalone output paths ✓\r\n\r\nNo blocking issues found.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--\r\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\r\nhttps://github.com/BillChirico/bills-bot/pull/60#pullrequestreview-3809561963\r\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\r\n\r\nMessage ID: <BillChirico/bills-bot/pull/60/review/3809561963@github.com>\n\nINSTRUCTIONS: Evaluate this email.
