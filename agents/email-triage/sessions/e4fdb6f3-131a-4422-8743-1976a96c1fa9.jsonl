Validation is done using Python&#39;s built-in `json.tool` to ensure the files are valid JSON, since `.xcstrings` files are JSON-based.\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\n\r\n- [X] CI/CD related changes\r\n- [X] i18n/l10n (Translation/Localization)\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [X] No\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\n\r\nMalformed or invalid `.xcstrings` files can be merged without any automated check catching the issue.\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n\r\nA new workflow (`.github/workflows/xcstrings-validation.yml`) runs on pull requests that modify `*.xcstrings` files and on manual dispatch. It finds all `.xcstrings` files in the repository and validates each one using `python3 -m json.tool`. The job runs on `ubuntu-slim` to keep the footprint small, since no macOS toolchain is needed for JSON validation.\r\nYou can view, comment on, or merge this pull request online at:\r\n\r\n  https://github.com/stonerl/Thaw/pull/165\r\n\r\n-- Commit Summary --\r\n\r\n  * feat(ci): add workflow to validate localization files and run SwiftLint\r\n  * refactor(ci): switch XCStrings validation to use Python on ubuntu-slim\r\n  * test(ci): trigger xcstrings validation pipeline\r\n  * Revert &quot;test(ci): trigger xcstrings validation pipeline&quot;\r\n\r\n-- File Changes --\r\n\r\n    A .github/workflows/xcstrings-validation.yml (28)\r\n\r\n-- Patch Links --\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/stonerl/Thaw/pull/165.patch\r\nhttps://github.com/stonerl/Thaw/pull/165.diff\r\n\r\n-- \r\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\r\nhttps://github.com/stonerl/Thaw/pull/165\r\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\r\n\r\nMessage ID: &lt;stonerl/Thaw/pull/165@github.com&gt;\r\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS: Evaluate this email.
