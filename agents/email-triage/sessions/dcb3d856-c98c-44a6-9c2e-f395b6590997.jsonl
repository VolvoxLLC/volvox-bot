Kinda like pushbullet, but much developer-friendlier and FOSS. Also has relay superpowers.\r\n\r\nI was going to ask for support of ntfy.sh via preset, because sending default json looks ugly. But reading the docs along the way, I discovered, that this is possible without any plugin&#39;s code modifications with ntfy&#39;s templates.\r\n\r\nI suggest adding this as example. While ntfy on its own might not be a well-known tool, notifications to handheld devices (without cluttering messengers) seem very valuable for this project.\r\nYou can view, comment on, or merge this pull request online at:\r\n\r\n  https://github.com/777genius/claude-notifications-go/pull/29\r\n\r\n-- Commit Summary --\r\n\r\n  * docs: add custom example for ntfy.sh\r\n\r\n-- File Changes --\r\n\r\n    M docs/webhooks/custom.md (25)\r\n\r\n-- Patch Links --\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/777genius/claude-notifications-go/pull/29.patch\r\nhttps://github.com/777genius/claude-notifications-go/pull/29.diff\r\n\r\n-- \r\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\r\nhttps://github.com/777genius/claude-notifications-go/pull/29\r\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\r\n\r\nMessage ID: &lt;777genius/claude-notifications-go/pull/29@github.com&gt;\r\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS: Evaluate this email.
