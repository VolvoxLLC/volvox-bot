Great work on this PR — the AX API approach for window focusing is really well thought out. The evolution from `code` CLI to `AXUIElement` makes a lot of sense, especially the points about VS Code's missing AppleScript dictionary and the subdirectory workspace matching issue. Clean solution.\r\n\r\nJust a heads up — I just merged #32 which touches some of the same files, so there will be merge conflicts. The overlapping files are:\r\n\r\n- `internal/notifier/notifier.go`\r\n- `internal/notifier/notifier_test.go`\r\n- `internal/hooks/hooks.go`\r\n- `internal/hooks/hooks_test.go`\r\n- `internal/notifier/terminal_darwin.go`\r\n\r\nHere's what changed in #32 so you have context for the conflicts:\r\n\r\n- **`SendDesktop` signature** now takes a third parameter `sessionID string` (used for notification threading)\r\n- **New CLI flags** for the Swift notifier: `-subtitle`, `-threadID`, `-timeSensitive`, `-nosound`\r\n- **Subtitle** is built from git branch + folder name (e.g. `\"main · my-project\"`) and passed via `-subtitle`\r\n- **Threading**: notifications are grouped by session via `-threadID`\r\n- **TimeSensitive**: API errors break through Focus Mode via `-timeSensitive` flag\r\n- **Nosound**: Go manages sound playback, so Swift notifier gets `-nosound` to avoid double sound\r\n- **`buildTmuxNotifierArgs`** also updated with the new params\r\n\r\nThe changes are orthogonal to yours (we add notification metadata, you add window focusing), so the conflicts should be straightforward to resolve. I'll handle the rebase/merge on my end.\r\n\r\n--\r\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\r\nhttps://github.com/777genius/claude-notifications-go/pull/31#issuecomment-3928723000\r\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\r\n\r\nMessage ID: <777genius/claude-notifications-go/pull/31/c3928723000@github.com>\n\nINSTRUCTIONS: Evaluate this email.
