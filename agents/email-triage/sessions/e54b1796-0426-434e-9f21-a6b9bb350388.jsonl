If `session` is refetched frequently (e.g., on window focus), this could cause multiple sign-out attempts. Consider tracking whether sign-out was already initiated:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nconst [signingOut, setSigningOut] = useState(false);\r\n\r\nuseEffect(() => {\r\n  if (session?.error === \"RefreshTokenError\" && !signingOut) {\r\n    setSigningOut(true);\r\n    signOut({ callbackUrl: \"/login\" });\r\n  }\r\n}, [session?.error, signingOut]);\r\n```\r\n\r\n--\r\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\r\nhttps://github.com/BillChirico/bills-bot/pull/60#pullrequestreview-3809562606\r\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\r\n\r\nMessage ID: <BillChirico/bills-bot/pull/60/review/3809562606@github.com>\n\nINSTRUCTIONS: Evaluate this email.
