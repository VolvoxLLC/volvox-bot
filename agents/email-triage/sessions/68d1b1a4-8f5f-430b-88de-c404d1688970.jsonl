Translation is not a problem.\r\nBut I’m not a coder. 😊\r\n\r\nSo I downloaded latest Xcode, copied the GitHub URL into the links and have now a ‘local’ copy I presume?\r\nI’ve added the language dutch and started translating. Currently on 37% and will try to finish it asap.\r\n\r\nBut then? How do I go about in uploading this? I read pull request and on Github I see that option.\r\nUnfortunatly I’ve never done this before but I’m eager to learn. If I can contribute in any way, I’m glad to…\r\n\r\nSo If you can give me a quick howTo in how I upload the translation to Github, you will have the translation to dutch by the end of tomorrow.\r\n\r\nSebastien Brusselle​​​​\r\nFreelance Consultancy & Management\r\n[signature_1452985045]\r\n***@***.******@***.***>\r\n[signature_3320760006]\r\n+32 477 050 477<tel:+32%20477%20050%20477>\r\n[signature_922280853]\r\nwww.sebr.be<http://www.sebr.be/>\r\n[SEBR BV]<http://www.sebr.be/>\r\n[LinkedIn]<https://www.linkedin.com/in/sbrusselle/>\r\n[Twitter]<https://twitter.com/SebaBrusselle>\r\nMatching IT & Software & Cloud.
