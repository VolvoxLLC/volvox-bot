This could facilitate the import and export of settings, meaning a menu bar could be replicated or reestablished entirely.\r\n\r\nAnd that option would facilitate the implementation of https://github.com/stonerl/Thaw/issues/18 and https://github.com/stonerl/Thaw/issues/21\r\n\r\n-- \r\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\r\nhttps://github.com/stonerl/Thaw/discussions/149#discussioncomment-15856407\r\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\r\n\r\nMessage ID: <stonerl/Thaw/repo-discussions/149/comments/15856407@github.com>\n\nINSTRUCTIONS: Evaluate this email.
