Clean implementation, well-tested!\r\n\r\nI pushed a small follow-up commit on top of your work with a few cross-platform improvements:\r\n\r\n- **Platform-specific build tags**: Extracted `sendTerminalBell()` into `bell_unix.go` (`!windows`) and `bell_windows.go` so it compiles cleanly everywhere. On Windows we write to `os.Stdout` since there's no `/dev/tty`.\r\n- **Consistent error handling**: Added write error check in the Unix path (was already in Windows).\r\n- **Added JSON config test** (`TestLoadConfig_TerminalBell`) to cover loading `terminalBell` from a real config file.\r\n- **Regression test** (`TestSendDesktop_BellWorksWhenDesktopDisabled`) — confirms bell works independently of `desktop.enabled`, which is important for headless/SSH users.\r\n\r\nAll tests pass (including race detection). Thanks for the contribution! 🎉\r\n\r\n--\r\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\r\nhttps://github.com/777genius/claude-notifications-go/pull/28#issuecomment-3907186396\r\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\r\n\r\nMessage ID: <777genius/claude-notifications-go/pull/28/c3907186396@github.com>\n\nINSTRUCTIONS: Evaluate this email.
