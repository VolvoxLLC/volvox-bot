The code quality is solid and follows security best practices.\r\n\r\n### Security ✅\r\n- **OAuth2 implementation**: Proper token refresh with graceful error handling (`RefreshTokenError` propagation)\r\n- **Open redirect prevention**: `callbackUrl` validation in login page (rejects absolute/protocol-relative URLs)\r\n- **Secret validation**: Runtime checks for `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` (min 32 chars, no placeholders)\r\n- **Security headers**: CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy configured\r\n- **Token exposure**: Access/refresh tokens stay server-side in JWT, not exposed to client session\r\n- **Bot API auth**: Refuses unauthenticated requests when `BOT_API_SECRET` is missing\r\n\r\n### Code Quality ✅\r\n- Rate limit retry logic with abort signal support\r\n- Cursor-based pagination for users in 200+ guilds\r\n- Graceful degradation when bot API unavailable\r\n- Proper error boundaries at root and global levels\r\n- AbortController cleanup in useEffect\r\n\r\n### Testing ✅\r\n- CI passes (80% coverage threshold enforced)\r\n- Comprehensive tests for auth callbacks, token refresh, rate limiting, pagination\r\n\r\n### Documentation ✅\r\n- Root README updated with web dashboard section\r\n- `.env.example` includes all required variables\r\n\r\nLGTM 🚀\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--\r\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\r\nhttps://github.com/BillChirico/bills-bot/pull/60#pullrequestreview-3810450945\r\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\r\n\r\nMessage ID: <BillChirico/bills-bot/pull/60/review/3810450945@github.com>\n\nINSTRUCTIONS: Evaluate this email.
