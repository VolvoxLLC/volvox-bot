The SwiftUI view observes `itemManager` and `imageCache`, so it re-renders automatically as background updates land.\r\n- **Background cache maintenance**: Rehide of temporarily-shown items, `cacheItemsIfNeeded`, and `updateCache` now run in a cancellable background `Task`. The task is cancelled in `close()` to avoid retaining `appState` unnecessarily.\r\n- **Animated icon support (~30fps)**: Added a lightweight `refreshImages(of:scale:)` method to `MenuBarItemImageCache` that performs a single composite screen capture and crops individual items, skipping full LRU/failure-tracking overhead. A `.task` modifier in `IceBarContentView` calls this at ~30 fps so animated icons (e.g. Google Drive sync spinner) stay live while the panel is open.\r\n\r\n## Test plan\r\n\r\n- [ ] Open IceBar — panel should appear immediately without a visible delay\r\n- [ ] Confirm hidden items are still correctly rehidden after the bar opens\r\n- [ ] Verify animated menu bar icons (e.g. Google Drive, Time Machine) animate while the IceBar is open\r\n- [ ] Close the IceBar and reopen — no stale icon state\r\n- [ ] Memory/CPU: confirm background task is cancelled on close and does not leak\r\nYou can view, comment on, or merge this pull request online at:\r\n\r\n  https://github.com/stonerl/Thaw/pull/167\r\n\r\n-- Commit Summary --\r\n\r\n  * perf(icebar): show panel instantly and animate menu bar icons at ~30fps\r\n\r\n-- File Changes --\r\n\r\n    M Thaw.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj (8)\r\n    M Thaw/MenuBar/IceBar/IceBar.swift (48)\r\n    M Thaw/MenuBar/MenuBarItems/MenuBarItemImageCache.swift (56)\r\n\r\n-- Patch Links --\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/stonerl/Thaw/pull/167.patch\r\nhttps://github.com/stonerl/Thaw/pull/167.diff\r\n\r\n--\r\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\r\nhttps://github.com/stonerl/Thaw/pull/167\r\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\r\n\r\nMessage ID: &lt;stonerl/Thaw/pull/167@github.com&gt;\r\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS: Evaluate this email.
