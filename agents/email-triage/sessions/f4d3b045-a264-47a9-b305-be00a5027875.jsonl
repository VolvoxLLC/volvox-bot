This caused unbounded\r\n  task accumulation during rapid mouse movement.\r\n\r\n  ## Test plan\r\n  - [ ] Enable &quot;Show on Hover&quot; in settings\r\n  - [ ] Move mouse rapidly in and out of the menu bar area\r\n  - [ ] Verify sections show/hide correctly without delay stacking\r\n  - [ ] Verify no excessive CPU usage during rapid mouse movement\r\nYou can view, comment on, or merge this pull request online at:\r\n\r\n  https://github.com/stonerl/Thaw/pull/154\r\n\r\n-- Commit Summary --\r\n\r\n  * fix(hover): cancel pending tasks to prevent concurrent delays\r\n\r\n-- File Changes --\r\n\r\n    M Thaw/Events/HIDEventManager.swift (11)\r\n\r\n-- Patch Links --\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/stonerl/Thaw/pull/154.patch\r\nhttps://github.com/stonerl/Thaw/pull/154.diff\r\n\r\n-- \r\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\r\nhttps://github.com/stonerl/Thaw/pull/154\r\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\r\n\r\nMessage ID: &lt;stonerl/Thaw/pull/154@github.com&gt;\r\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS: Evaluate this email.
