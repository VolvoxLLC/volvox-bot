(Issue #6)\n\nUtakata left a comment (SuperClaude-Org/SuperClaude_Plugin#6)\r\n\r\n## Resolved\r\n\r\nThis question has been addressed. The SuperClaude Plugin now includes:\r\n\r\n### Available Commands\r\n- **`/sc:setup-mcp`** — Interactive MCP server setup wizard that guides users through prerequisites, backup, configuration, and API key setup\r\n- **`/sc:verify-mcp`** — MCP server verification command to check installation status, connectivity, and troubleshooting\r\n\r\n### How MCP Works in the Plugin\r\nThe plugin uses **AIRIS MCP Gateway** (`uvx`) as a unified gateway, providing access to 10 tools through a single MCP server entry:\r\n- **6 free tools**: sequential-thinking, context7, git, puppeteer, playwright, chrome-devtools\r\n- **4 optional tools** (API key required): tavily, magic, serena, morphllm\r\n\r\n### Quick Start\r\nAfter installing the plugin, run:\r\n```\r\n/sc:setup-mcp    # Interactive setup wizard\r\n/sc:verify-mcp   # Verify everything works\r\n```\r\n\r\nMCP servers are **not** automatically installed with the plugin — the setup wizard guides users through the process step by step.\r\n\r\n--\r\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\r\nhttps://github.com/SuperClaude-Org/SuperClaude_Plugin/issues/6#issuecomment-3930969811\r\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\r\n\r\nMessage ID: <SuperClaude-Org/SuperClaude_Plugin/issues/6/3930969811@github.com>\n\nINSTRUCTIONS: Evaluate this email.
