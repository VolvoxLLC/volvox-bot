(Issue #33)\n\n777genius left a comment (777genius/claude-notifications-go#33)\r\n\r\nZellij click-to-focus support is now available in [v1.22.0](https://github.com/777genius/claude-notifications-go/releases/tag/v1.22.0)! 🎉\r\n\r\n### What's included\r\n\r\n- **Click-to-focus for zellij** — clicking a notification switches to the correct zellij tab and brings the terminal to the foreground\r\n- **Automatic detection** — detects zellij via `$ZELLIJ` / `$ZELLIJ_SESSION_NAME` environment variables (set automatically by zellij)\r\n- **Tab-level focus** — parses the active tab from `zellij action dump-layout` and uses `go-to-tab-name` to switch tabs on click\r\n- **E2E tested** — full end-to-end tests with real zellij sessions (tab switching roundtrips verified)\r\n\r\n**Note:** Zellij CLI only supports tab-level focus, not pane-level — this is a zellij limitation, not ours.\r\n\r\n### How to update\r\n\r\nIf you already have the plugin installed:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nclaude mcp # restart Claude Code — the plugin auto-updates on next hook invocation\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr manually:\r\n```bash\r\ncurl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/777genius/claude-notifications-go/main/bin/install.sh | bash -s -- --force\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Architecture bonus\r\n\r\nThis release also introduces a **multiplexer registry** — adding support for a new terminal multiplexer (screen, wezterm-mux, etc.) now requires just one file + one line in the registry. The core notification code doesn't need to change.\r\n\r\n--\r\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\r\nhttps://github.com/777genius/claude-notifications-go/issues/33#issuecomment-3933889227\r\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\r\n\r\nMessage ID: <777genius/claude-notifications-go/issues/33/3933889227@github.com>\n\nINSTRUCTIONS: Evaluate this email.
