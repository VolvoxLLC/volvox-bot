I’m still genuinely grateful for the early users who shared feedback, ideas, and encouragement.\r\n\r\nAfter about five years of self-funding, we ultimately removed Nikola from the App Store — but what we learned building it ended up shaping our next chapter.\r\n\r\nStandard Fleet (https://www.standardfleet.com/newsandinsights/standard-fleet-secures-13m-series-a-to-power-mixed-fleet-connectivity-launches-expanded-digital-key-platform)  was born from those learnings. (Fun fact: people kept connecting surprisingly large Tesla accounts to Nikola, which sparked the idea.) Today, we at Standard Fleet build software to help organizations manage fleets across 30+ automaker brands — including rental, aerospace, and autonomous programs — and we’ve built a modern, telematics & digital vehicle-access experience that enables more contactless operations.\r\n\r\nMy ask: we’re hiring software engineers who are excited to build consumer-grade software for the mobility/fleet world. If you’re interested — or you know someone exceptional — could you reply? Even a simple intro would mean a lot. Some of our best candidates have been early users of Nikola, as my early customers were smart, passionate, early-adopters.\r\n\r\nThanks again for being part of that early Nikola journey.\r\n\r\nDavid Hodge\r\nFounder & CEO, Standard Fleet (and one-time proprietor of Nikola Software)\r\n\r\nP.S. We’re backed by ~$20M from investors including Pierre Omidyar, Garry Tan, Joe Montana, Gokul Rajaram, and WEX (NYSE: WEX).\r\n\r\n============================================================\r\nYou can  ** unsubscribe from this list (https://nikolaapp.us4.list-manage.com/unsubscribe?u=e57e0a0d1d1f1048b18665a92&id=07e69569f3&t=b&e=f9d82cc212&c=01fffcce02)\r\n.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS: Evaluate this email.
