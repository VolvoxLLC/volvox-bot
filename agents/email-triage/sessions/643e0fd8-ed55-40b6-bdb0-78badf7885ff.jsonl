The job simply reads `needs.*` context values and writes to `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`; it does not interact with the repository, issues, or PRs, so it does not require write permissions and, strictly speaking, does not require any token scopes. The safest, least intrusive change is to add `permissions: contents: read` under the `summary` job, mirroring GitHub’s recommended minimal baseline, without altering any existing steps or behavior.\r\n\r\nConcretely:\r\n- Edit `.github/workflows/cleanup-commands.yml`.\r\n- Locate the `summary` job definition starting at line 209.\r\n- Insert a `permissions:` section under `runs-on: ubuntu-latest` (and before `needs:`) to restrict GITHUB_TOKEN for this job.\r\n- No additional imports, tools, or code changes are required; this is a pure YAML configuration update.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Suggested fixes powered by Copilot Autofix.
