Falls back to AppleScript title search by folder name, then plain app activation if the `code` CLI is absent.\r\n- **macOS / other apps**: AppleScript title search by project folder name (`filepath.Base(cwd)`); falls back to app activation when no window title matches.\r\n- **Linux**: threads `folderName` through daemon protocol (`FocusFolder` in `NotifyRequest`) so title-based focus methods (`busctl`, gdbus Eval, `wlrctl`, `xdotool`) search for the project folder name instead of the generic app name (e.g. &quot;Visual Studio Code&quot;).\r\n- All paths degrade gracefully to the existing `-activate`/app-activation behavior when `cwd` is empty or no matching window is found.\r\n\r\n## How it works\r\n\r\n`hookData.CWD` is now passed through `sendNotifications` → `SendDesktop(status, message, cwd)` → platform handler:\r\n\r\n- macOS: `buildFocusScript(bundleID, cwd)` picks the right strategy per app\r\n- Linux: `filepath.Base(cwd)` sent as `FocusFolder` to the daemon; `TryFocus(terminalName, folderName)` uses it in `GetSearchTermWithFolder`\r\n\r\n## Test plan\r\n\r\n- [ ] Trigger a hook with multiple VS Code windows open in different projects — clicking the notification should focus the correct project window\r\n- [ ] Verify workspace projects fall back to AppleScript title search or app activation gracefully\r\n- [ ] Verify behavior is unchanged when `code` CLI is not installed\r\n- [ ] Verify non-VS Code terminals still work (iTerm2, Terminal.app, Ghostty)\r\n- [ ] `go test ./...` passes (18/18 packages)\r\n\r\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\r\nYou can view, comment on, or merge this pull request online at:\r\n\r\n  https://github.com/777genius/claude-notifications-go/pull/31\r\n\r\n-- Commit Summary --\r\n\r\n  * fix: focus specific window on click-to-focus for VS Code and multi-window apps\r\n\r\n-- File Changes --\r\n\r\n    M internal/daemon/client.go (6)\r\n    M internal/daemon/focus.go (29)\r\n    M internal/daemon/mappings.go (16)\r\n    M internal/daemon/protocol.go (5)\r\n    M internal/daemon/server.go (30)\r\n    M internal/hooks/hooks.go (4)\r\n    M internal/hooks/hooks_test.go (4)\r\n    M internal/notifier/notifier.go (99)\r\n    M internal/notifier/notifier_test.go (175)\r\n    M internal/notifier/terminal_darwin.go (2)\r\n    M internal/notifier/terminal_linux.go (17)\r\n\r\n-- Patch Links --\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/777genius/claude-notifications-go/pull/31.patch\r\nhttps://github.com/777genius/claude-notifications-go/pull/31.diff\r\n\r\n--\r\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\r\nhttps://github.com/777genius/claude-notifications-go/pull/31\r\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\r\n\r\nMessage ID: &lt;777genius/claude-notifications-go/pull/31@github.com&gt;\r\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS: Evaluate this email.
