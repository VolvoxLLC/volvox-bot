''` (nullish coalescing) at lines 365 and 391 of `memory.js`, preserving IDs like `0` while handling `null`/`undefined`\r\n2. **formatRelations undefined** — Filters incomplete relations with `.filter((r) => r.source && r.relationship && r.target)`\r\n3. **buildMemoryContext timeout** — Wrapped with `Promise.race` and 5s timeout in `ai.js`\r\n4. **Fire-and-forget safety** — `extractAndStoreMemories` only logs errors, no `markUnavailable()` call\r\n5. **checkMem0Health timeout** — 10s timeout with `Promise.race` in `index.js`\r\n6. **Pure isMemoryAvailable** — Split into pure getter + `checkAndRecoverMemory()` with side effects\r\n7. **Batch deletion loop** — `/memory forget topic` now loops with batch size 100, up to 1000 memories\r\n8. **Memory context budget** — 2000-char limit with truncation\r\n9. **Username in metadata** — Passed as metadata only, not baked into content\r\n\r\nThe health check race condition (flagged by Cursor bot) is properly addressed via `AbortSignal` — when the timeout fires, it aborts the signal before calling `markUnavailable()`, and `checkMem0Health` checks `signal?.aborted` before calling `markAvailable()`.\r\n\r\nCI passing. Tests comprehensive. No issues found.\r\n\r\n--\r\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\r\nhttps://github.com/BillChirico/bills-bot/pull/63#issuecomment-3906136330\r\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\r\n\r\nMessage ID: <BillChirico/bills-bot/pull/63/c3906136330@github.com>\n\nINSTRUCTIONS: Evaluate this email.
