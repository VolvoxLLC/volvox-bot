I'm the Homebrew maintainer who added this in https://github.com/stonerl/Thaw/commit/95d9a42e11ad88a627224c33906da1c5ed7386f5. `--cask` was intentionally left out. We don't allow token conflicts anymore, so there won't be any other software called `thaw` or `thaw@beta` in the main taps. It's fine to have this, but it's essentially a no-op that makes the install command longer for no benefit. Your call @stonerl!\r\n\r\n-- \r\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\r\nhttps://github.com/stonerl/Thaw/pull/156#issuecomment-3928988279\r\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\r\n\r\nMessage ID: <stonerl/Thaw/pull/156/c3928988279@github.com>\n\nINSTRUCTIONS: Evaluate this email.
