While the messages are hardcoded and not user-controlled (so not exploitable), for consistency with the defense-in-depth approach, consider adding a `safeUpdate` wrapper in a follow-up PR. Low priority since these are confirmation button responses with static text.\r\n\r\n🔵 **Nitpick — `withResponse: true` in ping.js**\r\n`src/commands/ping.js:11`\r\n\r\nThe `withResponse: true` option was added in discord.js v14.14+ to return a response object with `resource.message`. The test mocks match this structure. This is a newer API feature — verify it works as expected in production.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Verdict**: ✅ **Approved** — Critical issues from previous reviews have been addressed. The remaining items are minor nitpicks that don't block merging.\r\n\r\n--\r\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\r\nhttps://github.com/BillChirico/bills-bot/pull/62#issuecomment-3906010685\r\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\r\n\r\nMessage ID: <BillChirico/bills-bot/pull/62/c3906010685@github.com>\n\nINSTRUCTIONS: Evaluate this email.
