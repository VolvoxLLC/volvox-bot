After thorough review, the implementation is solid and ready to merge.\r\n\r\n### Strengths\r\n- **Security:** Access tokens kept server-side (not exposed to client session), proper NEXTAUTH_SECRET validation, security headers configured, XSS protections in place\r\n- **Architecture:** Clean separation with `server-only` imports, proper TypeScript types, cursor-based guild pagination\r\n- **Error handling:** Comprehensive token refresh error propagation, global error boundary, graceful degradation when bot API unavailable\r\n- **Testing:** 80%+ coverage with thorough tests for auth flows, rate limiting, and component behavior\r\n- **Docker:** Multi-stage build with standalone output, healthcheck, proper monorepo context handling\r\n\r\n### Minor Notes (nitpicks only)\r\n1. `global-error.tsx` could inherit the main layout's `className=\"dark\"` on the `<html>` tag for consistency\r\n2. `server-selector.tsx` could validate JSON response shape before casting\r\n\r\nBoth are minor polish items that don't block approval.\r\n\r\n**CI Status:** ✅ Passing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--\r\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\r\nhttps://github.com/BillChirico/bills-bot/pull/60#pullrequestreview-3810263680\r\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\r\n\r\nMessage ID: <BillChirico/bills-bot/pull/60/review/3810263680@github.com>\n\nINSTRUCTIONS: Evaluate this email.
