So what's the best way?\r\n\r\nYou can try scrapbooking. One of the most time-honored methods to preserve articles from newspapers or magazines. Scrapbooking is tedious and doesn't your achievement deserve to be on full display?\r\n\r\nThere's also framing. Go to the local art supply store, get some matting, frame and glue, maybe make a passable display. Or pay a professional framer to do all that. But its expensive and after all the effort the framed article will quickly fade and look tired.\r\n\r\nSo what then is the answer? Preserving articles and clippings with custom wall displays is the way to go!\r\n* Our process stops articles fading, backed by a lifetime guarantee.\r\n* We re-touch images to remove blemishes.\r\n* Saves you a ton of time as we do all the work. From getting the article original to layout and crafting the final plaque.\r\n\r\nView Plaque Choices\r\nhttps://mw.thatsgreatnews.com/index.php/campaigns/sv714mqs6r617/track-url/dw499jptfq2a7/722cd9da05cdd2f94eb7968a0d7095d1b167100b]\r\n\r\nWe want you to be totally satisfied, so we make a simple promise. If when you've received your plaque you don't like it we'll give you your money back.\r\n\r\nWhen you want the best, look at our new Classic Frame. Sleek, timeless and compliments any decor. That is something you can't get\r\nfrom a traditional framing shop.\r\n\r\nArticle\r\nBuilding Dreams: From High School Hacks to Volvox, With Bill Chirico, Volvox’s Founder\r\nFeatured\r\nBill Chirico, Volvox\r\nPublication\r\nVolvox\r\nPublished\r\nJanuary 27th 2026\r\n\r\nUnconditional 100% money back guarantee on all plaques.
