Now, AX queries only run once per app switch\r\n  - Split the method into a cache-checking wrapper and a private\r\n    `computeApplicationMenuFrame()` method with the original logic unchanged\r\n  - Added `@MainActor` annotations to ensure thread safety of the static cache\r\n\r\n  ### Known limitation\r\n  The cache is not invalidated when the same app changes its menu structure\r\n  (e.g., document-based apps adding/removing menus). This is an acceptable\r\n  tradeoff — the consequence is a few pixels of hit-testing imprecision that\r\n  self-corrects on the next app switch.\r\n\r\n  ## Test plan\r\n  - [ ] Move mouse rapidly across the menu bar — verify no UI stuttering\r\n  - [ ] Switch between apps — verify menu bar hit-testing updates correctly\r\n  - [ ] Test with secondary display — verify application menu detection works\r\n  - [ ] Open Instruments (Time Profiler) — confirm AXHelpers calls only occur on app switch\r\nYou can view, comment on, or merge this pull request online at:\r\n\r\n  https://github.com/stonerl/Thaw/pull/159\r\n\r\n-- Commit Summary --\r\n\r\n  * perf(screen): add caching for application menu frame\r\n\r\n-- File Changes --\r\n\r\n    M Thaw/Utilities/Extensions.swift (34)\r\n\r\n-- Patch Links --\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/stonerl/Thaw/pull/159.patch\r\nhttps://github.com/stonerl/Thaw/pull/159.diff\r\n\r\n--\r\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\r\nhttps://github.com/stonerl/Thaw/pull/159\r\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\r\n\r\nMessage ID: &lt;stonerl/Thaw/pull/159@github.com&gt;\r\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS: Evaluate this email.
