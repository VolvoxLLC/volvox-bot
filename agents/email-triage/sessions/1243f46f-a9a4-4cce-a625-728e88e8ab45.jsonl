(Issue #33)\n\n777genius left a comment (777genius/claude-notifications-go#33)\r\n\r\nHey, thanks for the quick feedback — awesome that you spotted the tmux support so fast, it literally just shipped in [v1.20.0](https://github.com/777genius/claude-notifications-go/releases/tag/v1.20.0) (via [#32](https://github.com/777genius/claude-notifications-go/pull/32))!\r\n\r\nZellij support is definitely on the radar. I did some research and here's where things stand:\r\n\r\n**What's feasible today:**\r\n- **Detection** is straightforward: `$ZELLIJ`, `$ZELLIJ_SESSION_NAME`, `$ZELLIJ_PANE_ID` env vars\r\n- **Tab-level focus** works well: `zellij --session <name> action go-to-tab-name \"<tab>\"` — clicking a notification could switch to the correct tab\r\n\r\n**Current limitation (on zellij's side):**\r\n- **Pane-level focus by ID is not available via CLI** — there's no `zellij action focus-pane <id>` command. The only way is through the plugin API (Rust/WASM). This is a known gap: [zellij-org/zellij#3061](https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij/issues/3061)\r\n- So unlike tmux where we can target the exact pane (`select-window` + `select-pane`), zellij would be limited to tab-level granularity for now\r\n\r\nThat said, tab-level focus is still useful — especially if you run Claude Code in a dedicated tab. I'll keep this issue open and look into implementing it.\r\n\r\nAre you using zellij with multiple panes per tab, or mostly one-pane-per-tab? That would help gauge how important pane-level targeting is for your workflow.\r\n\r\n--\r\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\r\nhttps://github.com/777genius/claude-notifications-go/issues/33#issuecomment-3933163197\r\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\r\n\r\nMessage ID: <777genius/claude-notifications-go/issues/33/3933163197@github.com>\n\nINSTRUCTIONS: Evaluate this email.
