The implementation follows established patterns and has comprehensive test coverage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--\r\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\r\nhttps://github.com/BillChirico/bills-bot/pull/60#pullrequestreview-3809706180\r\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\r\n\r\nMessage ID: <BillChirico/bills-bot/pull/60/review/3809706180@github.com>\n\nINSTRUCTIONS: Evaluate this email.
