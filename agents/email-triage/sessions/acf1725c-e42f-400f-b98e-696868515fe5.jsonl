All three values come from controlled sources:\r\n\r\n- `tmuxPath` — `exec.LookPath(\"tmux\")` → `/opt/homebrew/bin/tmux`, `/usr/bin/tmux` etc. Unix binary paths never contain single quotes.\r\n- `socketPath` — parsed from `$TMUX` env var → `/private/tmp/tmux-501/default`. Tmux socket paths are created by tmux itself with safe characters.\r\n- `paneTarget` — tmux pane ID format `%N` (e.g. `%42`). Always `%` + digits.\r\n\r\nAdding a `shellQuote` helper would be defensive coding against a scenario that cannot happen in practice.
