Window-specific focus is a substantial contribution — it touches the entire pipeline from hooks through notifier to the daemon.\r\n\r\nWe've merged it and made a few improvements on top of your code:\r\n\r\n1. **`titleMatchesFolder`** — replaced substring matching (`containsString`) with component-based matching: window titles are now split by \" — \" and \" - \" and compared exactly against each component. This eliminates false positives like folder `app` matching a window titled `my-app`.\r\n\r\n2. **`sanitizeForAppleScript`** — instead of stripping `\"` and `\\`, we now properly escape them: `\\\"`, `\\\\`, and single quotes use the shell `'\\''` technique. Folders like `it's-project` or `path\"with\"quotes` now match correctly.\r\n\r\n3. **`SendQuickNotification()`** — extracted a standalone function for one-off notifications (no Notifier instance needed). Built `promptScreenRecordingOnce()` on top of it — when Screen Recording permission is missing, a one-time notification is shown with a click action that opens System Settings directly.\r\n\r\nQuestion: have you tested the actual click-to-focus logic on macOS / Linux? Specifically manual testing — multiple VS Code windows, switching between Spaces, clicking the notification. On Linux — the xdotool/wlrctl path with folder name.\r\n\r\nI'm about to publish a new release, so you'll be able to test with an actual build soon!\r\n\r\n--\r\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\r\nhttps://github.com/777genius/claude-notifications-go/pull/31#issuecomment-3932959852\r\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\r\n\r\nMessage ID: <777genius/claude-notifications-go/pull/31/c3932959852@github.com>\n\nINSTRUCTIONS: Evaluate this email.
