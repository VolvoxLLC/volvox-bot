With multiple call sites doing `removeAll { $0 == tag }`, a\r\n  single cache update cycle could trigger hundreds of linear scans.\r\n\r\n  ## Complexity comparison\r\n\r\n  | Operation | Before (Array) | After (Dictionary) |\r\n  |---|---|---|\r\n  | `updateAccessOrder` | O(n) removeAll + O(1) append | O(1) counter increment + dict\r\n  set |\r\n  | Bulk update (n tags) | O(n²) — n × removeAll | O(n) — n × dict set |\r\n  | Cache cleanup | O(n) removeAll per tag | O(1) removeValue per tag |\r\n  | LRU eviction | O(n) filter + prefix | O(n log n) sort (infrequent) |\r\n  | Deduplication pass | O(n) reverse-filter-reverse | Not needed (dict is unique) |\r\n\r\n  ## Test plan\r\n\r\n  - [ ] Build succeeds with no warnings\r\n  - [ ] Verify IceBar displays menu bar item images correctly\r\n  - [ ] Verify Layout Bar in Settings shows images\r\n  - [ ] Verify search panel shows item images\r\n  - [ ] Monitor console logs for &quot;Cache inconsistency&quot; warnings (should not appear)\r\nYou can view, comment on, or merge this pull request online at:\r\n\r\n  https://github.com/stonerl/Thaw/pull/162\r\n\r\n-- Commit Summary --\r\n\r\n  * refactor(image-cache): improve LRU tracking efficiency\r\n\r\n-- File Changes --\r\n\r\n    M Thaw/MenuBar/MenuBarItems/MenuBarItemImageCache.swift (98)\r\n\r\n-- Patch Links --\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/stonerl/Thaw/pull/162.patch\r\nhttps://github.com/stonerl/Thaw/pull/162.diff\r\n\r\n--\r\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\r\nhttps://github.com/stonerl/Thaw/pull/162\r\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\r\n\r\nMessage ID: &lt;stonerl/Thaw/pull/162@github.com&gt;\r\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS: Evaluate this email.
