I just installed Beta 8, seems to work well. The Menu Bar Layout is working perfectly. The smoothest I've ever experienced on Thaw (and definitely compared to ICE). \r\n\r\nAt first \"Hide App Menus...\" didn't work at all. I restarted Mac, toggled the option off/on a few times, but it works on almost every app after closing the Thaw Settings window. Typically, after closing the window, the first attempt to hide menu apps doesb't change the opened/last used app menus... but toggle the Thaw icon a few times and it eventually works. \r\n\r\nI hope this feedback helps. And again, thanks for all of the hard work on this!
