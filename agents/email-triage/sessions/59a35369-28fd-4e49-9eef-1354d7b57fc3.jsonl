And would require extensive testing, since once I did a simple test loading a file with a different icon, it did not update and Xcode had to close it because it started to have a memory leak (fixed it). But I was able to partially verify that some settings being reestablished from the JSON files actually work, for example, once I got a file with Launch at login set to true, I got the macOS notification for it. \r\n\r\nAs an improvement once I looked at the exported file, I consider not adding values like enableDiagnosticLogging due to their potential implications. \r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"advanced\": {\r\n    \"enableAlwaysHiddenSection\": true,\r\n    \"enableDiagnosticLogging\": false,\r\n    \"enableSecondaryContextMenu\": true,\r\n    \"hideApplicationMenus\": true,\r\n    \"showAllSectionsOnUserDrag\": true,\r\n    \"showOnHoverDelay\": 0.2\r\n  },\r\n  \"general\": {\r\n    \"autoRehide\": true,\r\n    \"customIceIconIsTemplate\": true,\r\n    \"iceBarLocation\": 2,\r\n    \"iceIcon\": {\r\n      \"hidden\": {\r\n        \"catalog\": {\r\n          \"_0\": \"Chevron\"\r\n        }\r\n      },\r\n      \"name\": \"Dot\",\r\n      \"visible\": {\r\n        \"catalog\": {\r\n          \"_0\": \"DotStroke\"\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    },\r\n    \"itemSpacingOffset\": 0,\r\n    \"rehideInterval\": 15,\r\n    \"rehideStrategy\": 0,\r\n    \"showIceIcon\": true,\r\n    \"showOnClick\": true,\r\n    \"showOnHover\": true,\r\n    \"showOnScroll\": true,\r\n    \"useIceBar\": true,\r\n    \"useIceBarOnlyOnNotchedDisplay\": true\r\n  },\r\n  \"hotkeys\": {},\r\n  \"launchAtLogin\": true\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1262\" height=\"914\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/810e691c-d95e-462d-aff0-9958feb70540\" />\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\r\nhttps://github.com/stonerl/Thaw/issues/21#issuecomment-3925482965\r\nYou are receiving this because you commented.\r\n\r\nMessage ID: <stonerl/Thaw/issues/21/3925482965@github.com>\n\nINSTRUCTIONS: Evaluate this email.
