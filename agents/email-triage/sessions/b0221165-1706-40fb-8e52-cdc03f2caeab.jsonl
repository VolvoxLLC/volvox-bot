It now is still linked to the click on the Thaw icon.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. go to settings, enabled only on displays with notch\r\n2. notice how displays without notch still hide the icons when clicking on the thaw icon on the notch screen, basically it should not hide the menu on non-notch screens.\r\n\r\n### App Version\r\n\r\n1.0.1-beta.8 (13)\r\n\r\n### macOS Version\r\n\r\n26.3\r\n\r\n### Monitor Setup\r\n\r\nMulti-monitor Setup\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n-- \r\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\r\nhttps://github.com/stonerl/Thaw/issues/119\r\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\r\n\r\nMessage ID: <stonerl/Thaw/issues/119@github.com>\n\nINSTRUCTIONS: Evaluate this email.
