The code quality is generally high with good patterns for:\r\n\r\n- Token refresh handling with error propagation\r\n- Rate limiting with retry logic for Discord API\r\n- Cursor-based pagination for guilds\r\n- Open redirect prevention in login callback\r\n- Proper security headers in next.config.ts\r\n- Comprehensive test coverage\r\n\r\n### Issue Found\r\n\r\n**Documentation not updated** — Per AGENTS.md, documentation must be kept up to date after every code change. The main `README.md` needs updates to document:\r\n\r\n1. The web dashboard feature in the Features section\r\n2. Web-specific environment variables (DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET, NEXTAUTH_SECRET, NEXTAUTH_URL, BOT_API_URL, BOT_API_SECRET, NEXT_PUBLIC_DISCORD_CLIENT_ID)\r\n3. Web dashboard setup instructions\r\n4. Architecture diagram update showing the dashboard component\r\n\r\nSimilarly, `AGENTS.md` should include web dashboard files in the Key Files table and document web-specific conventions.\r\n\r\nSee inline comment for details.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--\r\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\r\nhttps://github.com/BillChirico/bills-bot/pull/60#pullrequestreview-3809707945\r\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\r\n\r\nMessage ID: <BillChirico/bills-bot/pull/60/review/3809707945@github.com>\n\nINSTRUCTIONS: Evaluate this email.
