However, there is one critical issue that must be fixed before merging:\r\n\r\n### 🔴 Critical Issue\r\n\r\n**Opt-out state not loaded on startup** - `loadOptOuts()` is never called during the startup sequence in `src/index.js`. This means after a bot restart, users who previously opted out will have their messages sent to mem0 for memory extraction, violating their explicit privacy choice. This is a data privacy bug that must be fixed.\r\n\r\n### 🟡 Warnings\r\n\r\n1. **Memory defaults to enabled when config fails** - In `src/modules/memory.js`, the catch fallback in `getMemoryConfig()` defaults `enabled: true`. Consider defaulting to `false` for fail-safe behavior.\r\n\r\n### 🔵 Nitpicks\r\n\r\n1. **Inconsistent `markUnavailable()` in delete functions** - `deleteAllMemories` and `deleteMemory` don't call `markUnavailable()` on errors, unlike other API functions.\r\n\r\n### ✅ What's Good\r\n\r\n- Clean ESM module structure following project conventions\r\n- Proper Winston logging (no console.* usage)\r\n- Comprehensive test coverage with 806 lines of memory tests\r\n- Good error handling with graceful fallbacks\r\n- Proper use of `splitMessage()` utility for Discord limits\r\n- Well-documented JSDoc comments\r\n- Privacy notice in module header\r\n- Admin commands properly check permissions\r\n- Ephemeral replies for sensitive data\r\n\r\nSee inline comments for specific locations and suggested fixes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--\r\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\r\nhttps://github.com/BillChirico/bills-bot/pull/59#pullrequestreview-3806175439\r\nYou are receiving this because you were assigned.\r\n\r\nMessage ID: <BillChirico/bills-bot/pull/59/review/3806175439@github.com>\n\nINSTRUCTIONS: Evaluate this email.
