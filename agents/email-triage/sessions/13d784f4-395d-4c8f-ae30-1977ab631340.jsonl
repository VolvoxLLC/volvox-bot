The graceful degradation approach is solid, and the security handling (`sanitizeForAppleScript`, `shellQuote`) looks good.\r\n\r\nThere's just one issue that needs fixing before we can merge — the Windows CI is failing:\r\n\r\n### `terminal_other.go` needs the updated signature\r\n\r\nThe PR updated `sendLinuxNotification` to accept a new `cwd string` parameter in both `terminal_darwin.go` and `terminal_linux.go`, but the Windows/other-platform stub in `terminal_other.go` still has the old 4-parameter signature:\r\n\r\n```go\r\n// current (line 36 in terminal_other.go):\r\nfunc sendLinuxNotification(title, body, appIcon string, cfg *config.Config) error {\r\n    return beeep.Notify(title, body, appIcon)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe call site in `notifier.go:100` now passes 5 arguments:\r\n```go\r\nsendLinuxNotification(title, cleanMessage, appIcon, n.cfg, cwd)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis causes `go vet` to fail on Windows:\r\n```\r\ninternal\\notifier\\notifier.go:100:72: too many arguments in call to sendLinuxNotification\r\n    have (string, string, string, *config.Config, string)\r\n    want (string, string, string, *config.Config)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Fix** — just add the `cwd` parameter to the stub (it can be ignored since Windows doesn't use it):\r\n\r\n```go\r\nfunc sendLinuxNotification(title, body, appIcon string, cfg *config.Config, cwd string) error {\r\n    return beeep.Notify(title, body, appIcon)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Optional (non-blocking) suggestion\r\n\r\n`GetSearchTermWithFolder` duplicates the logic from `GetSearchTerm`. You could reduce duplication by delegating to `GetSearchTerm` as a fallback:\r\n\r\n```go\r\nfunc GetSearchTermWithFolder(terminalName, folderName string) string {\r\n    lowerName := strings.ToLower(terminalName)\r\n    if folderName != \"\" && (lowerName == \"code\" || lowerName == \"vscode\" || lowerName == \"visual studio code\") {\r\n        return folderName\r\n    }\r\n    return GetSearchTerm(terminalName)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is purely a code hygiene thing though — totally fine to address later or skip entirely.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOnce the `terminal_other.go` fix is in and Windows CI goes green, this is good to merge. Thanks again for the great work! 👏\r\n\r\n--\r\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\r\nhttps://github.com/777genius/claude-notifications-go/pull/31#issuecomment-3925952462\r\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\r\n\r\nMessage ID: <777genius/claude-notifications-go/pull/31/c3925952462@github.com>\n\nINSTRUCTIONS: Evaluate this email.
