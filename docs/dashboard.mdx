# Web Dashboard

The Volvox Bot admin dashboard (`web/`) is a Next.js application that provides a browser-based interface for managing your Discord server's bot configuration, moderation actions, and analytics.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Node.js 22+
- pnpm
- A running Volvox Bot instance with `BOT_API_PORT` exposed (default: 3001)
- Discord OAuth2 application credentials

### Setup

```bash
cd web
cp .env.example .env.local
# Fill in your Discord OAuth2 credentials and bot API URL
pnpm install --legacy-peer-deps
pnpm dev
```

The dashboard will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

> **Note:** `--legacy-peer-deps` is required due to NextAuth v4 + Next.js 16 peer dependency constraints.

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `NEXTAUTH_URL` | Canonical URL of the dashboard (e.g. `http://localhost:3000`) |
| `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` | Random secret for JWT encryption. Generate with `openssl rand -base64 48` |
| `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID` | Discord OAuth2 application client ID |
| `DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET` | Discord OAuth2 application client secret |
| `BOT_API_URL` | URL of the bot's REST API (e.g. `http://localhost:3001/api/v1`) |
| `BOT_API_SECRET` | Shared secret matching `BOT_API_SECRET` in the bot's `.env` |

## Signing In

1. Navigate to the dashboard URL
2. Click **Sign in with Discord**
3. Authorize the OAuth2 app — you'll only see servers where you and the bot are both present
4. Select your server from the server picker

Sessions persist via NextAuth.js JWTs. Discord tokens are refreshed automatically when they expire.

## Dashboard Pages

### Overview

The landing page after server selection. Shows:
- **KPI cards** — Member count, messages today, AI responses, active users
- **Activity chart** — Message volume over the last 7 days
- **Top channels** — Most active channels by message count

### Config

Configure all bot settings from the browser. Changes are applied live and persisted to the database.

- Use the section tabs (AI, Triage, Moderation, Starboard, etc.) to navigate
- **Role fields** use Discord-synced dropdown pickers — no manual ID copy-paste
- **Channel fields** use Discord-synced channel selectors with category grouping
- Changes save on blur/submit and show a success/error toast

### Analytics

Detailed activity analytics for the guild:
- **Message volume** — Line chart with channel-level filtering
- **AI usage** — Token usage, response counts, model breakdown by day
- **Activity heatmap** — Hour × day grid showing peak usage times
- **Top contributors** — Most active members by message count

### Moderation

View and manage mod actions:
- **Cases table** — All warnings, bans, kicks, timeouts with search and filter
- **Quick actions** — Issue warnings or timeouts directly from the dashboard
- **Case detail** — View full case history with reason and executor

### Members

Member management panel:
- **Member list** — All guild members with XP, join date, and role badges
- **Member detail** — Click any member for their full mod history, XP breakdown, and case list
- **XP editor** — Adjust a member's XP directly (requires admin)
- **Export** — Download member data as CSV

### AI Conversations

Browse and manage AI conversation history:
- **Conversation list** — All conversations with timestamp, channel, and message count
- **Search** — Full-text search across conversation content
- **Flag** — Mark conversations for review
- **Flagged view** — Filter to show only flagged conversations

### AI Feedback

> Requires `ai.feedback.enabled: true` in config.

When AI feedback is enabled, users can react 👍 or 👎 to the bot's responses. This page shows:
- **Aggregate stats card** — Total positive, negative, and approval ratio (%)
- **Daily trend chart** — Feedback sentiment over the past 30 days (configurable)
- **Recent feedback list** — Individual reactions with message link, user, and timestamp

Use this data to gauge how well the bot's responses are landing and iterate on the system prompt.

### Audit Log

History of all mutating API actions performed by dashboard users or API key callers:
- **Action type** — config edit, member kick, case create, etc.
- **Executor** — Who performed the action (Discord user ID + username)
- **Target** — The affected resource (user, config key, etc.)
- **Timestamp** — When it happened

Retention is controlled by `auditLog.retentionDays` in config (default: 90 days).

### Tickets

Manage support tickets opened via the `/ticket` command:
- **Ticket list** — All open/closed tickets with status, opener, and channel
- **Ticket detail** — View the full message thread for a ticket
- **Close/reopen** — Manage ticket state from the dashboard

## Themes

The dashboard supports **dark mode** and **light mode** with system preference detection. Use the theme toggle in the top-right corner to switch.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Can't see my server | Ensure bot is in the server. Check `BOT_API_URL` and `BOT_API_SECRET` in `.env.local`. |
| "Session expired" errors | Verify `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` is set and consistent (don't change it between restarts). |
| Config saves fail | Check `BOT_API_URL` points to the running bot API. Verify the config key is in `SAFE_CONFIG_KEYS`. |
| Role/channel dropdowns empty | Check bot has `View Channels`, `Read Message History`, and `Manage Roles` permissions in the server. |
| AI feedback page shows no data | Set `ai.feedback.enabled: true` in config and ensure users have started reacting to bot messages. |
