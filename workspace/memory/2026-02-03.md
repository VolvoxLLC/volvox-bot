## Bill-Bot (Volvox Discord Bot)

### Created standalone Discord bot
- **Repo:** https://github.com/BillChirico/bill-bot
- **Tech stack:** Node.js + discord.js v14 + Winston logging
- **Features:** AI chat, welcome messages, spam detection, slash commands
- **AI routing:** Calls OpenClaw's `/v1/chat/completions` → uses Bill's Claude subscription

### Architecture (after modular refactor)
```
src/
├── commands/        # Slash commands (ping, status, config)
├── modules/         # Feature modules (ai, welcome, spam, events)
├── utils/           # Utilities (health, permissions, registerCommands)
├── logger.js        # Structured logging (Winston)
└── index.js         # Main entry
```

### Deployment
- **Local:** PM2 on WSL (`pm2 start bill-bot`)
- **Railway:** Set env vars for remote OpenClaw access
- **OpenClaw URL:** `https://bill.tail8b4599.ts.net/v1/chat/completions` (Tailscale Funnel)

### Issues Fixed
- undici 7.x requires Node 20+ → pinned to `>=6.23.0 <7.0.0`
- discord.js deprecations: `ready` → `clientReady`, `fetchReply` → `withResponse`
- Closed 5 conflicting PRs (built on old architecture before modular refactor)
- Removed redundant `deploy-commands.js` (commands auto-register on startup)

## OpenClaw Config Changes

### macOS App Connection
- Switched gateway from `bind: tailnet` → `bind: loopback` + `tailscale.mode: serve`
- Enabled identity-based auth via Tailscale (no token needed from Tailscale peers)
- Approved Bill's MacBook Pro device pairing

### Thinking Level
- Set `thinkingDefault: "xhigh"` initially
- Found xhigh not supported on all models → cron jobs set to `thinking: "high"`

### Volvox Bot (OpenClaw agent)
- Enabled briefly, then disabled in favor of standalone bill-bot
- Token regenerated: `MTQ2NzIzNjY2NDg1MzEzOTQ3Nw.GX0-gz...`
- Added CRITICAL rule to SOUL.md: NEVER use @everyone or @here

## Cron Jobs
- Cleaned up 8 old one-time reminders
- Fixed Morning/Evening Digest: added `to: "user:191633014441115648"` for Discord DMs
- Set `thinking: "high"` on both digest jobs (xhigh caused errors)

## Reddit API
- Submitted application for API access (requires manual review now)
- Can still use public JSON endpoints in the meantime

## DecisionJar (from earlier)
- Cloudflare Worker deployed for OpenAI proxy
- PR #65 ready to merge
- Still need to rotate compromised OpenAI key
