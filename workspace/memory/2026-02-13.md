## Gmail / Job Applications

- JGS Insurance - application logged via Chirico email webhook. Bill will hear from HR if they want more info.
- Patriot Software - rejection sent as DM. Bill should expect to hear back or follow up.
- Sobers App Lead - Actionable business info received via Gmail hook. Notified Bill via Discord/iMessage.
- The Hartford - Candidate account verification email received (bill@chirico.dev). Contains verification link expiring in 24 hours. Notified Bill via Discord/iMessage. Applying for .NET Staff Software Engineer position in Alpharetta, GA.

## Key Events / Tasks

- Discord DM routing fixed: Changed dmScope from "main" to "per-account-channel-peer" so Pip Build DMs route correctly. Fixed Discord user ID typo (650→648) for both pip and pip-build accounts. Gateway restarted.
- Claude usage: 5h 0%, 7d 100%. Monitoring 7-day usage closely as it resets on Feb 15.
- GitHub backups: Running successfully every heartbeat and cron.

## Notes

- All webhook emails are being logged and Bill is being notified via Discord/iMessage for action-required items.
- Job application responses are handled as "no immediate action needed" unless urgent/verification codes.
- Verification codes/links are sent immediately via both Discord DM and iMessage per HEARTBEAT.md.
- Todoist shows 10 overdue tasks (5 are priority 1). Bill may want to review.
