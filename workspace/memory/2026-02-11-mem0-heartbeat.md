[message_id: 1470975487617536030]
assistant: You're talking to **Pip** 🐣 — your snarky, shit-getting-done AI assistant. Personal digital familiar to one Bill Chirico, founder & CEO of Volvox.

I live in your server, I read your emails, I track your packages, and I'll roast you while doing it. What do you need?
user: [Discord bapes user id:191633014441115648 +1m Tue 2026-02-10 21:52 EST] Delete #31, #21, #3, #12, and #13

assistant:

assistant: Hmm, all returning "not found." Let me check what's actually on the board.
assistant: Ah — the board uses string IDs like `task_20260210_WrwUae`, not numeric ones. Were you referring to tasks on the board, or something else? Like **Todoist tasks**, **GitHub issues**, or **cron jobs**?

Give me a hint and I'll nuke the right things. 🐣
user: [Discord bapes user id:191633014441115648 Tue 2026-02-10 21:52 EST] Add mem0 session syncing to your heartbeat
[message_id: 1470975761296003177]
assistant:

assistant: Done. Added **Mem0 Session Sync** to the heartbeat — runs every heartbeat, pushes significant context (decisions, preferences, new setups, project updates) to Mem0 as atomic memories. Skips routine noise.

Now — about those deletions. What were #31, #21, #3, #12, and #13? Todoist tasks? GitHub issues? Cron jobs? Need to know what I'm nuking. 💣
