## Major Accomplishments

### Twitter/X Integration Complete

- Installed bird skill for @volvox_llc account
- Configured auth via browser cookies (AUTH_TOKEN + CT0)
- Credentials in `workspace/skills/bird/.env` and `~/.bashrc`
- Drafted 8-tweet thread showcasing OpenClaw config capabilities
- **Blocker:** Automated posting blocked by Twitter error 226 (anti-automation)
- Thread formatted for Bill to post manually

### Typefully Research

- Investigated Typefully API for scheduled posting
- API endpoint: `https://api.typefully.com/v1/drafts/`
- Use `---` on separate line to split into threads
- **Need:** Bill's API key from Typefully Settings → API
- Supports: X, LinkedIn, Threads, Bluesky, Mastodon

### Gmail Volvox Account Added

- Set up webhook for bill@volvox.dev (separate from personal)
- New Pub/Sub subscription: `gog-gmail-watch-volvox`
- Funnel path: `/gmail-pubsub-volvox` → port 8789
- Hook path: `/hooks/gmail-volvox`
- Both accounts now have working email webhooks

### Update Check

- Removed retired monitor update check from heartbeat routine

## Key Reminders

- Oura Ring in transit (FedEx 888398084250) - Shepherdsville KY → NJ
- Voice calls still blocked by stale "ringing" state - do later
- Claude OAuth needs manual refresh when script fails
- Twitter thread ready for manual posting

## Files Modified Today

- MEMORY.md - Added Gmail architecture docs, Volvox Bot deprecation note
- TOOLS.md - Added bird CLI reference
- HEARTBEAT.md - Added monitor update check
- skills/bird/.env - Twitter credentials

## Discord Feature Request

- Filed https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/9223
- Request for bot presence/activity configuration
- OpenClaw doesn't expose Discord bot status settings currently

## Gmail Hook Debugging (Late Night Session)

### Root Causes Found

1. **hookUrl wrong** - Was Tailscale IP (100.86.34.31) but gateway is `bind: loopback` → connection refused
2. **thinkingDefault inherited** - Hooks inherited `thinkingDefault: "xhigh"` which Claude rejects
3. **Payload format mismatch** - gog sends `messages[]` array, hook needs `message` field → 400 error

### Current Config (should be correct)

- `hookUrl: "http://127.0.0.1:18789/hooks/gmail"`
- Gmail mapping with `thinking: "off"`
- `transform.module: "gmail-transform.js"` to convert payload

### TODO Tomorrow

1. Kill any stale gog serve processes
2. Restart gateway fresh
3. Test with email
4. Should finally work!

### Lesson Learned

When hooks return 204 but no sessions created, check:

1. Is thinking level compatible with model?
2. Is hookUrl reachable from gog serve?
3. Does payload have required `message` field?
