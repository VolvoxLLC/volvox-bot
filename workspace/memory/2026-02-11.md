# 2026-02-11 Daily Notes

## Late Night Session (12:00 AM - 12:20 AM)

### verboseDefault Fixed (from prior session, documenting here)

- `agents.defaults.verboseDefault` was `"on"` — caused tool call spam in Discord
- Changed to `"off"` via config.patch, gateway restarted
- Bill can toggle per-session with `/verbose`

### Post-Heartbeat Summary DMs (MANDATORY)

- Bill requested a DM after EVERY heartbeat summarizing what was done
- Added to HEARTBEAT.md: Claude usage %, backup status, services restarted, alerts, Mem0 sync
- Keep it 3-5 bullet points max

### Mem0 Sync Made Mandatory After Conversations

- Bill asked if I was syncing to Mem0 regularly — I wasn't tracking it
- Updated HEARTBEAT.md with explicit rules: sync after every conversation + every heartbeat
- Added `mem0Sync` to heartbeat-state.json for tracking

### Discord Markdown Expert

- Bill sent Discord Markdown Text 101 guide, told me to master it
- Studied full reference: text formatting, headers, subtext (-#), masked links, block quotes, code blocks with syntax highlighting, spoiler tags, lists
- Saved comprehensive reference to MEMORY.md
- Pushed to Mem0

### Veritas Board Webhook Duplication

- Board webhook fired 4+ times for same completed task (`task_20260211_h9e7gV`)
- Similar to Gmail dedup issue — may need a dedup transform for board hooks too
- Task was "Config slash command deep autocomplete" for bill-bot — completed successfully

### Claude Usage

- 5-hour window reset around midnight — dropped from 55% to 5%
- 7-day at 71%

### Message Tool accountId Required

- `message action=send` to Discord DM needs `accountId: "pip"` — without it, returns 401 Unauthorized
- Discovered during first heartbeat summary DM attempt

## Gmail Webhooks — All 3 Accounts Live (~12:35 AM)

- Bill asked if all 3 emails have webhooks — only 2 were set up
- **billchirico@gmail.com** (port 8788, `/hooks/gmail`) — was working ✅
- **bill@volvox.dev** (port 8789, `/hooks/gmail-volvox`) — was getting 404 (no hook mapping existed!)
- **bill@chirico.dev** (port 8790, `/hooks/gmail-chirico`) — not set up at all
- Fixed: Added `gmail-volvox` and `gmail-chirico` hook mappings to config
- Started third gog serve process for bill@chirico.dev on port 8790
- All 3 accounts now have working webhook pipelines with dedup transform

## bill-bot PR Split (~12:28 AM)

- Bill noticed PR #14 (`feat/db-config`) had two tasks mixed in
- Split into two PRs:
  - **PR #14** (`feat/db-config`) — PostgreSQL-backed config persistence only
  - **PR #15** (`feat/deep-autocomplete-dynamic-welcome`) — deep autocomplete + dynamic welcome
- Used cherry-pick + force push to cleanly separate commits

## Veritas Board Webhook CRISIS (~12:20 AM - 12:45 AM)

- Board webhook fired 30+ times for the same two completed tasks
- `task_20260210_iMiRWN` (dynamic welcome) re-triggered 15+ times
- `task_20260211_h9e7gV` (config autocomplete) re-triggered 10+ times
- The webhook kept re-implementing completed work, dirtying the working tree
- Had to `git checkout -- .` at least 4 times to revert unwanted changes
- **Rate-limited both fallback providers** (openai-codex cooldown + Google Gemini billing error)
- Root cause: No dedup on board webhooks — every task:updated/task:reordered event triggers a full hook session
- **URGENT:** Needs dedup transform like gmail-dedup.js, or disable the webhook entirely
- DM'd Bill about the crisis twice

## Heartbeat Summary DMs Removed (~12:56 AM)

- Bill asked to stop sending heartbeat summary DMs — too noisy
- Removed the "Post-Heartbeat Summary" section from HEARTBEAT.md
- Still DM for important stuff (alerts, login codes, etc.), just no routine reports

## Veritas Webhook Stragglers (~12:45 AM - 12:55 AM)

- Even after Bill fixed the dedup, long-running sessions from before the fix kept completing
- Several 17-18 minute sessions finished and dirtied the working tree
- Had to `git checkout -- .` multiple times to revert
- All changes are safe in PR #15, the stragglers just kept re-implementing on `feat/db-config` branch

## Discord Message Tool — accountId Required

- `message action=send channel=discord target=user:...` returns 401 without `accountId`
- Must include `accountId: "pip"` for all Discord DMs
- Discovered during first heartbeat summary DM attempt

## Mem0 Migration (from Zep backend)

- Replaced `workspace/zep/zep.js` implementation with a Mem0-backed CLI while keeping the same legacy command path (`node zep/zep.js ...`) so existing workflows don’t break.
- Removed hardcoded Zep API usage and switched to Mem0 API endpoints:
  - `POST /v1/memories/` for writes
  - `POST /v2/memories/` for context/listing
  - `POST /v2/memories/search/` for search/node-style queries
- Added strict env-key requirement in CLI: `MEM0_API_KEY` (or `MEMZERO_API_KEY` / `MEMORY_API_KEY` fallback var names).
- Updated docs/instructions to reflect Mem0 as the structured memory backend:
  - `workspace/AGENTS.md`
  - `workspace/TOOLS.md`
  - `workspace/MEMORY.md`
- Removed Zep SDK dependency from workspace npm manifests:
  - `workspace/package.json`
  - `workspace/package-lock.json`
- Added `.env` placeholder comment for Mem0 key setup.

## Validation

- `node zep/zep.js` prints Mem0 help.
- `node zep/zep.js test` correctly fails when no `MEM0_API_KEY` is present.
- `MEM0_API_KEY=dummy node zep/zep.js test` hits Mem0 endpoint and returns expected 401 invalid key (confirms endpoint wiring is correct).

## Token Usage Script Created (~1:30 AM)

- Built `workspace/scripts/token-usage.ts` — TypeScript analysis of per-session token breakdown
- Usage: `npx tsx scripts/token-usage.ts [--hours N] [--agent main|build] [--top N]`
- Helped identify the Veritas webhook crisis burned ~530k tokens (97.8% of 4-hour usage)

## TOOLS.md Update In Progress (~2:40 AM)

- Bill confirmed "Yes update it" for TOOLS.md mcporter/MCP server documentation
- Was reading TOOLS.md (~558 lines) and searching for mcporter references (lines 326, 512+)
- **NOT COMPLETED** — session hit compaction before edit could be made
- Need to update: mcporter section (line 326+) and mem0 section (line 512+) with current server list and commands

## Pre-Compaction State (~2:42 AM)

- Context at 91% (181k/200k) — compaction triggered
- Claude usage: 27% 5h / 74% 7d — healthy
- All services running: Gmail hooks (3 accounts), SendBlue proxy, backup cron
- Main model: anthropic/claude-opus-4-6, Build model: same with codex fallback
- MCP servers active: github (40 tools), context7 (2 tools), mem0 (9 tools)

## Post-Compaction Session (~2:43 AM - 6:03 AM)

### Claude Usage Spike & Fallback (~2:44 AM - 5:00 AM)

- Usage climbed: 69% → 81% → 85% → 87% → 93% 5-hour (Veritas webhook crisis aftermath)
- Alerted Bill at each threshold crossing (elevated, high, critical)
- Switched to GLM 4.7 fallback at 93% (~4:46 AM)
- Token refresh failed during heartbeat — ran `claude` with pty myself to fix
- 5-hour window reset at 5:00 AM EST — back to 2%, switched back to Opus

### Sonnet Usage Mystery (~3:02 AM)

- Bill asked why his Sonnet usage was at 100%
- Investigated: zero Sonnet references anywhere in openclaw.json config
- All our models: Opus 4.6, Haiku 4.5, GLM 4.7, GPT 5.2, Codex 5.3
- Likely culprit: Claude Code direct usage (defaults to Sonnet)

### CCS (Claude Code Switch) Debugging (~3:55 AM - 4:04 AM)

- Bill trying to use github.com/kaitranntt/ccs — "invalid management key" error
- Researched: CCS uses CLIProxyAPI under the hood
- Management key lives in CLIProxyAPI's config.yaml under `remote-management.secret-key`
- Key auto-hashes with bcrypt on first startup — can cause mismatch
- Error was specifically when connecting Codex OAuth provider
- Advised Bill to check config.yaml and set fresh plaintext key

### Build Agent Status (~5:15 AM)

- Bill asked what build agent was doing — confirmed idle
- Build agent configured in agents list but has no Discord binding
- Only activates via Veritas webhooks or explicit targeting
- No active build sessions in past 24 hours

### OpenClaw Dashboard Access (~5:52 AM - 5:55 AM)

- Bill accessing dashboard from phone via Tailscale
- URL: https://bill.tail8b4599.ts.net (proxies to gateway port 18789)
- Got "pairing required" — needed gateway auth token
- Token: in gateway.auth.token config (also in OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN env)
- Dashboard is tailnet-only (serve, not funnel) — confirmed secure
- Only webhooks (SendBlue, Gmail, voice) are exposed via Funnel

### Secret Manager Task (~5:57 AM - 6:01 AM)

- Bill wants a secret/API key manager set up this afternoon
- Created Todoist task: "Set up secret & API key manager for Pip" (ID: 6fxm43pX3PPv6f98)
- Spawned sub-agent to research options with cost analysis
- **Result: SOPS + age recommended** as best fit
  - Zero infrastructure, git-safe, two binaries, programmatic access
  - HashiCorp Vault ruled out (overkill, BSL license, 2GB+ RAM, unsealing)
  - Infisical noted as upgrade path if we need UI/rotation later
  - Full implementation plan posted to Todoist task comments
  - Estimated setup: ~1.5 hours

### Services Restarted (~2:44 AM)

- Gmail volvox (port 8789) and chirico (port 8790) hooks were down — restarted
- SendBlue proxy (port 3456) was down — restarted
- All confirmed running after restart

### Pre-Compaction State #2 (~6:03 AM)

- Claude usage: 20% 5h / 86% 7d — healthy
- All services running
- Backup pushed to GitHub
- Context at compaction threshold again

### Secret Manager — Remote Research (~6:09 AM - 6:18 AM)

- Bill asked: "How does SOPS prevent people from reading the file if they have access to my computer?"
- Explained: SOPS + age protects git/backup exposure but NOT local shell access
- Bill said: "We need a remote option look into it"
- Spawned second sub-agent for remote secret manager research
- **Result: Doppler recommended** (free forever, unlimited secrets, 5-min setup)
- **Runner-up: Google Secret Manager** (~$0.84/mo, Bill already has GCP project `billsopenclaw`)
- Bill asked: "Not counting price which is better?"
- **Google Secret Manager wins on security** — enterprise IAM, audit logs, encryption, 99.95% SLA, versioning, native rotation
- Doppler wins on DX (`doppler run` is slick) but Google is more robust foundation
- Bill seemed to lean toward Google — one fewer vendor, already in the ecosystem

### Morning Digest Delivered (~9:00 AM)

- Cron job fired successfully
- Weather: 42°F mostly sunny, breezy (W wind 15-20, gusts 30)
- Todoist: 1 due today (secret manager setup), 9 overdue (mostly post-PH launch tasks)

  - Secret manager implementation (Google Secret Manager chosen) — afternoon task
  - Veritas webhook dedup monitoring
  - Evening digest cron routing reliability

## Morning Session (9:23 AM - 11:08 AM)

### Digest Format Update (~9:22 AM)

- Bill requested each digest section be sent as a separate Discord message instead of one combined wall
- Updated both Morning Digest and Evening Digest cron jobs
- Each section (weather, tasks, calendar, PH, reddit, email/news) = one message

### Mem0 Sync Overhaul (~9:24 AM - 9:31 AM)

- Bill asked when last Mem0 sync was — found it was 9.5 hours overdue
- Pushed 7 memories covering overnight events
- Bill requested a proper sync log file tracking all periodic tasks
- Rebuilt `memory/heartbeat-state.json` from scratch — clean ISO 8601 timestamps
- 15 tracked tasks with cadences: mem0, claude usage, backup, token refresh, morning updates, todoist, gmail hooks, sendblue, openclaw updates, bill check-in, PR monitor, package tracking, email, calendar, weather
- Updated HEARTBEAT.md with master tracking table + explicit "check lastRun / update lastRun" for every section

### Gmail Webhook Mappings Fixed AGAIN (~9:35 AM - 9:41 AM)

- Bill asked why no email notifications — investigated logs
- **Personal:** empty log (no output)
- **Volvox:** "ignoring push" for all events (filtering other accounts' pushes)
- **Chirico:** "hook failed: hook status 404" — gateway had no endpoint!
- **Root cause:** `gmail-volvox` and `gmail-chirico` hook mappings were MISSING from config (only `sendblue` and `gmail` existed)
- This is the **3rd time** these mappings have disappeared — likely from config overwrites
- Fixed: Added both mappings back via `config.apply` with full config
- Gateway restarted, chirico hook fired OK within 1 minute
- Backed up config before and after

### Claude Usage Warning (~9:42 AM)

- 76% 5h / 93% 7d — WARNING threshold crossed
- Alerted Bill via Discord DM
- Build agent identified as culprit: 122k tokens in 5h (bill-bot CI fix task burned 102k alone)
- Main agent only used 12k tokens

### Build Agent Token Investigation (~9:43 AM)

- Bill asked where all usage went
- Used `token-usage.ts` script to analyze
- Build agent session 402444f4: 102,587 tokens on "Fix CI errors + 80% test coverage for bills-bot" (PR #16)
- Task got compacted/retried 3 times (same prompt re-injected at 9:05, 9:14, 9:24 AM)
- Build agent burned 815k tokens over 7 days across 12 sessions

- Bill requested npm package updates
- Updated: codesession-cli 1.8.5 → 1.9.0, pnpm 10.29.2 → 10.29.3

### Tesla Temperature Monitor (~9:48 AM - 9:53 AM)

- Bill asked to be notified when car hits 70°F inside
- Climate already ON, interior at 42°F → 56°F → 72°F
- Set up cron job checking every 2 minutes
- Car hit 72°F at 9:53 AM — notified Bill via Discord DM, deleted cron job

### HEARTBEAT.md — Dual Channel Notifications (~10:04 AM)

- Bill reminded: "Don't forget to add sending me iMessages through SendBlue as well!"
- Updated HEARTBEAT.md to require BOTH Discord DM + iMessage for all important notifications
- Was previously only mentioning Discord

### Email Delivery Issue (~10:27 AM)

- bill@chirico.dev → afelipe@perfectserve.com bouncing
- SPF/DKIM validation failure over IPv6
- Gmail retrying for 46 hours
- Notified Bill via both Discord + iMessage (first use of dual-channel!)
- Bill said it's probably a one-off with PerfectServe, no DNS fix needed

### GitHub Issue Reply (~10:44 AM)

- UYTR5 replied to Bill's Thaw feature request (stonerl/Thaw#73)
- Asking for clarification on "double-click to reveal" vs existing "Automatically rehide"
- Notified Bill with link

### Cursor Bugbot PR (~11:01 AM)

- Bugbot found race condition in bill-bot PR #18 (AI conversation persistence)
- Fix: `getHistory` mutate array in place with `unshift()` instead of replacing map entry
- Bill said: **Don't use Cursor Bugbot PRs** — sub-agents (Pip Build) handle fixing PR comments instead

### Mem0 Two-Way Sync (~11:07 AM)

- Bill pointed out Mem0 sync should be two-way, not just push
- Updated HEARTBEAT.md: now requires PULL from Mem0 (search for new memories) AND PUSH (write new ones)
- Was only doing one-way (push) this whole time

### OpenClaw PR #13672 MERGED 🎉

- Discovered during 9:42 AM heartbeat

### Cursor Bugbot Alert on bill-bot PR #16 (~11:36 AM)

- Gmail hook surfaced a **high-severity** Bugbot finding on bill-bot PR #16:
  - `events.js` used `Events.ClientReady` (resolves to `ready`)
  - `index.js` still used string `clientReady`
  - would break slash command registration on startup

- Updated fallback to **GPT-5-Codex**: `openai-codex/gpt-5.3-codex` at **90%+** 5-hour Claude usage
- Synced this change across HEARTBEAT.md, TOOLS.md, and MEMORY.md

### ClawGuard References Removed (~11:59 AM)

- Bill requested all ClawGuard references be removed from active files
- Removed ClawGuard section from TOOLS.md and references from MEMORY.md + historical daily notes

### Veritas Location Corrected in TOOLS.md (~12:03 PM)

- Bill confirmed Veritas should stay, but location needed correction
- Updated TOOLS.md Veritas path from `workspace/veritas-kanban` to `workspace-build/veritas-kanban`
- Updated the Veritas start command to use `/home/bill/.openclaw/workspace-build/veritas-kanban`

### User Profile Cleanup to USER.md (~12:07 PM)

- Bill asked whether personal profile data should live in `USER.md` — confirmed yes
- Expanded `USER.md` into canonical profile file (identity, links, preferences, workflow)
- Cleaned `MEMORY.md` by moving Bill-profile/preference sections out and replacing with pointer to `USER.md`

### Tone Preference Reminder (~12:04 PM)

- Bill said Pip should use its emoji/personality more again (less sterile tone)
- Added this as a standing communication preference in `USER.md`

### USER.md Second Pass Cleanup (~12:12 PM)

- Bill requested a second pass to trim leftover profile data in non-user files
- Moved address + AI subreddit watchlist into `USER.md`
- Removed `Bill's Location` and watchlist details from `TOOLS.md` (left a pointer to `USER.md`)
- Replaced remaining digest/contact profile leftovers in `MEMORY.md` with pointers to `USER.md`

### Discord Notes Relocated to TOOLS.md (~12:16 PM)

- Bill asked if Discord operational notes should live in TOOLS instead of MEMORY
- Moved Discord message-tool/accountId rule + formatting quickref into `TOOLS.md`
- Replaced Discord reference block in `MEMORY.md` with a pointer to `TOOLS.md`

### Always Announce File Updates Rule (~12:20 PM)

- Bill mandated that Pip MUST always announce which files are being updated and summarize the changes.
- Added this as a core rule in `AGENTS.md` under the "Write It Down" section.

### GLM 5 Support Added (~12:35 PM)

- Bill requested support for the newly released `z.ai glm-5` model.
- Patched `openclaw.json` to add `zai/glm-5` to the allowlist and model aliases.

### GLM-5 Support & Gateway Fixes (~12:55 PM - 1:00 PM)

- **GLM-5 Support:** Fully enabled `zai/glm-5` (alias `glm`). Added to `agents.defaults.models` allowlist and `auth.profiles`.
- **Auth Fix:** Configured `zai:default` with `api_key` mode in `openclaw.json`.
- **Gmail Watcher Fix:** Added `GOG_KEYRING_PASSWORD` to the gateway environment via `config.apply` to resolve keyring access errors (`no TTY available`) in logs.
- **Gateway Stability:** Performed full `config.apply` followed by `systemctl --user restart openclaw-gateway.service` to ensure model allowlist and environment changes were fully propagated.
- **Heartbeat & Health:** Confirmed all services healthy: Gmail (3 accounts), SendBlue proxy, and GitHub backup.
- **Claude Usage:** 51% 5-hour / 100% 7-day (moderate).

### Riverside.fm Export (~12:55 PM)

- "Arduino UNO R3 Robot Project" export completed.
- Delivered preview link to Bill: <https://riverside.fm/dashboard/editor/preview/9ce82d8c-baf9-4cca-ae23-50e334f96e3a/698cc1aa186f2ea5f3916127?utm_campaign=share-exported-clip>

## Afternoon Updates (1:45 PM - 2:10 PM)

### Pip Build 404 Investigation (~1:53 PM)

- Bill reported Pip Build getting 404 errors.
- Investigated logs: found "404 Not Found" errors from the `zai` provider.
- Root cause: `zai` was set to `api.z.ai`, which didn't recognize the brand new `glm-5` model released today.
- Anthropic and Codex were in cooldown, so Pip Build was stuck on the 404ing ZAI fallback.

### GLM-5 Official Support & Fallback Hardening (~1:58 PM - 2:05 PM)

- Updated `openclaw.json` ZAI `baseUrl` to official BigModel endpoint: `https://open.bigmodel.cn/api/paas/v4`.
- Removed `zai/glm-5` from all fallback chains to prevent future lockups.
- Added `google/gemini-3-flash-preview` as a reliable fallback for both `main` and `build` agents (right after Codex).
- Performed `config.apply` and restarted gateway.

### Massive Session Cleanup (~2:00 PM - 2:05 PM)

- Scrubbed hanging sessions (100+) from `agents/main/sessions/` and `agents/build/sessions/`.
- Manually reset both `sessions.json` files to only include the active main session.
- Verified session list is now pristine (just the active session).

### Claude Usage (~2:08 PM)

- 51% 5-hour / 100% 7-day (moderate).
- 5h window resets at ~3:00 PM EST.

### Zhipu AI GLM-5 Release

- GLM-5 was released today (Wednesday, Feb 11, 2026).
- Flagship model designed for complex coding and agentic tasks.
- Successfully configured official API support.
