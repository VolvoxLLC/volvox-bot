assistant: Claude Opus 4.6 — the big brain. This is the **build** agent, so I'm running the same default model. No overrides, no fallbacks active right now.

assistant: Done — switched to **Gemini 3 Flash Preview**. Fair warning, this is a downgrade from Opus so don't expect the same level of sophistication. Want me to stay on this or was it just a test?
